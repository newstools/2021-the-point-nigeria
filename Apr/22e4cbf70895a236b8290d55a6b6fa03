 TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A cleric, Reverend T. O. Onifade, has claimed that Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State inherited a state “in darkness” from his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola. Onifade, the Chaplain of the Osun State Government House Chapel, made this known on Sunday while delivering homily at the 61st Birthday Thanksgiving Service of the Governor’s wife, Mrs Kafayat Oyetola. He described Governor Oyetola as the light that had shone in the darkness of Osun, adding that he had cleared doubts about the ability of the All Progressives Congress to deliver the dividends of democracy in the State. Onifade maintained that the situation in Osun before Oyetola’s assumption of office, were inimical to the welfare of citizens and could be described as a time of darkness. The cleric who said that Oyetola had brought the qualities that made him outstanding in his professional calling to governance, noted that he was in government to serve and not to enrich himself. According to him, Oyetola’s accomplishments over two years are stepping stones for the state to attain greatness beyond 2022. In his remarks at the service, which witnessed the attendance of government officials, the Governor said that God promised him that the state would rise from its doldrums. Oyetola explained that the developmental strides being recorded under his administration were testaments to God’s promise. The governor added that his administration was committed to pursuing God’s mandate “till Osun becomes the toast of the nation.” He called on residents to continue to support the programmes and policies of his administration towards actualising the God-given mandate.
