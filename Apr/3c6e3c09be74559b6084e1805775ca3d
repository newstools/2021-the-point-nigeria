 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI FOLLOWING the renewed crisis between Ezzillo and Iyionu communities, both in Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, on Monday, the state government has ordered the arrest of the Councillor representing Ezzillo ward. Briefing newsmen shortly after this week’s security meeting on Tuesday, at the Executive Council Chambers, Old
Government House, Abakaliki, Governor David Umahi accused the Councillor of unlawfully inviting expatriates into the government-declared buffa zone as a result of greed. Confirming the unfortunate deaths of the natives, Umahi disclosed that the trespass initiated by the Councillor led to the killing of two persons and ordered his immediate arrest. “On the Iyionu-Ezzillo crisis, this misunderstanding has been there for a very long time. Some of these land disputes have been there for over 100 years. And CAN under the leadership of Rev fr Abraham Nwali has been working very hard and has really reached a point where the land in dispute was declared a buffa zone,” he said. “But unfortunately, a Councillor from Ezzillo, out of greed, took an expatriate investor to the disputed land and that led to shooting and killing where two persons died,” he added. The Governor noted that the Catholic bishop of Abakaliki had directed Fr Abraham to step in and he had done that. “So, they have agreed there will be no more shooting and killings and that they will abide by any government decision on it. The security council meeting today 20th April 2021 directed the immediate arrest of that Councillor and for him to be prosecuted immediately,” he disclosed.
