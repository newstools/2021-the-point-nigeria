 AYO ESAN GOVERNOR Seyi Makinde, on Thursday, inaugurated the Governing Council of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, charging the Council to provide leadership that would take the institution to the acme of excellence in the world. The governor charged members of the Council to, within a short while, ensure that the institution is ranked among the top 10 universities in the world. He also charged members to oversee and ensure accountability on the part of the institution’s direct administrators. Governor Makinde stated these while inaugurating the Council members at the Executive Chamber of the Governor’s Office, Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan, on Thursday. The governor also called on Council members to see their positions as call to duty and service, adding that “this is not a job one gets and goes to sleep.” He said the mandate given to the committee was to take necessary and strategic measures that would make LAUTECH one of the 10 top universities in the world and the first in Africa. Speaking on the specific mandate being given to the new Council, the governor said, “We want you to take the necessary measures and pursue vigorously all strategies and tactics that will make LAUTECH a world-class university. That is the mandate. “What you are getting is an opportunity to shape this school for future generations. We no longer have the excuse to say one state or the other is holding back the school’s progress. So, I encourage you to get the job done and I am sure you will get it done.” The governor explained that though the Governing Council was almost invisible, its impact “is always felt in the direction the school is headed.” He said the appointment of the Council members was a call to service and duty that must be heeded with every sense of responsibility.
