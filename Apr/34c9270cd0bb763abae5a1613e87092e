 SALIU SALIU TROOPS of the Nigerian Army have rescued five of the 39 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka, Kaduna State. The students, who were kidnapped on March 11, 2021, have been in their abductors’ den since then. Their parents had accused the Kaduna State Government of being insensitive and vowed to negotiate with the bandits on their own to secure the release of their children. The bandits had released a video where the victims were seen begging the Federal Government to pay ransom and secure their release urgently. Director, Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Yerima, in a statement, listed the rescued students to include Abubakar Yakubu, Francis Paul, Obadiya Habakkuk, Amina Yusuf and Maryam Danladi.
