 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Osun State Police Command has commenced investigations into the cause of death of a student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Adedeji Emmanuel. Though the circumstances surrounding Emmanuel’s death has not been ascertained, sources said he committed suicide after a failed digital currency deal. The deceased student, who was in the Management and Accounting Department of the institution, was said to have taken a poisonous substance called Sniper, which led to his death. He was reported to have died a few minutes later in the school premises. His colleagues said his corpse was discovered behind the Mechanical Department, popularly known as Spider building. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Yemisi Opalola, said in a statement on Wednesday, that the police was investigating whether the deceased actually died as a result of drinking Sniper. “The deceased’s body has been taken to the morgue of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital while investigation has been launched to unravel the circumstances surrounding his death,” Opalola said. “The Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode, urged parents to always counsel their children and ward on the need to share their problems rather than resorting to suicide,” she added.
