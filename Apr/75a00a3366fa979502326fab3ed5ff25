 REBECCA AJANI ELDER Statesman and former Leader of pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, has expressed support for the presidential ambition of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Fasoranti expressed his support for the former Governor of Lagos State when he received members of the South West Agenda for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (SWAGA 23), in his country home, in Akure, Ondo State. “Tinubu has all it takes to rule Nigeria. Considering his activities and track record, he deserves to be President, come 2023. May his prayers be answered. When he gets there, he will do all we want,” Fasoranti said. He added that, with Tinubu as president, all the prayers of Afenifere for Nigeria would be answered, particularly on the issue of restructuring and federalism. Chairman and Coordinator, SWAGA, Dayo Adeyeye, said the Yoruba people must unite and speak with one voice, ahead of the 2023 presidential race, adding that the house must not be divided before the race. According to him, the team has visited more than 50 traditional rulers across the six states of the South-West geopolitical zone for their royal blessings. Expressing the confidence that the presidency would be zoned to the South in 2023, he, however, said it could be any of the zones in the South. Adeyeye said there was therefore a need to quickly begin the movement for Yoruba to unite. “Tinubu has all it takes to rule the country, being a detribalised Nigerian who loves the masses and is blessed with enormous wisdom,” he said. The SWAGA’23 Chairman, however, said members of the team began consultations on their own, having found Tinubu worthy of Presidency. The APC national leader did not initiate the move, he noted.
