 BY SALIU SALIU GOVERNOR Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State said, on Sunday, that the state government had not appointed intermediaries to negotiate with bandits. He insisted that the Government would not negotiate with or pay ransom to bandits, warning that anyone claiming to be doing so in any capacity would be prosecuted if found. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in the state, Samuel Aruwan, made this position known while reacting to reports that the state had appointed representatives to interface with bandits on its behalf. “The Kaduna State Government hereby clarifies firmly that such intermediaries have never been appointed,” he said. “The Government will not negotiate with or pay ransoms to bandits. Any person who claims to do so in any capacity, if found, will be prosecuted accordingly,” the state government warned. It urged citizens to report the details of any persons posing as official government negotiators to the Kaduna State Security Operations Room on 09034000060 and 08170189999, or email internal.security@kdsg.gov.ng.
