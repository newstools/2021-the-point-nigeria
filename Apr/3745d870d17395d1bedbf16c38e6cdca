 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Osun State Police Command has arrested a suspected Fulani herdsman, identified as Salisu Sulaiman, for allegedly attempting to abduct some residents of the state. Confirming the arrest on Wednesday, the spokesperson of the Police, Mrs Yemisi Opalola, said the suspect, aged 18, hails from Ifofihan in Kwara State. Opalola said the suspect was arrested around 12:15pm on Tuesday and that manhunt continued for other fleeing suspects. Sulaiman and other fleeing members of his gang had on Sunday invaded Koka community in Obokun Local Government Area of the State at night and made efforts to kidnap the residents. The AK-47 wielding men of the underworld were said to have attacked the residents of the community that shares boundaries with the Osun State University, Osogbo campus, and ordered them to march out of their various houses. It was gathered that while the residents were being taken to the bush, one of them veered off the line, unknown to the gunmen and put a telephone call to the Hunters Group of Nigeria in the state. On receiving the distress call, the hunters were said to have arrived the village and foiled the kidnap attempt. There was a gun duel between the suspected Fulani hersdmen, the hunters and some locals, it was learnt. Overpowered, the gunmen were said to have angrily shot three of their victims and left others to flee from the community.
