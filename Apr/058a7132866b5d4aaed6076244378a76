 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE NATIONAL Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, has said the main opposition party is willing to partner with the African National Congress to deepen democracy in Africa. He said Nigeria had a lot to learn from South Africa, especially as regards the conduct of credible and transparent elections. Secondus spoke when he received the South African High Commissioner, Thamsanqa Dennis Mseleku, at the PDP headquarters, in Abuja. While noting that Nigeria was distressed as a result of security challenges, he said the country would “need help from anybody who can help in ideas and other logistics to bring peace in the land.” The PDP National Chairman also commended the President Cyril Ramaphosa-led government for its uncommon interest and support for Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala for the World Trade Organization job, which she got. In his response, the High Commissioner said his home government would continue to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries. Nigeria and South Africa must come together to save the continent, he said, adding that there was no hope for the continent if the two countries failed to work together. On the frequent defections by politicians,Mseleku said South Africa had witnessed the same trend in the past until it found a stabilising way of dealing with the issue.
