 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Federal Executive Council did not deliberate on whether the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, should continue to stay in office or not, on Wednesday. The public had expected this to be a major issue for discussion, especially considering calls for him to be sacked over his “offensive” past positions on the activities of extremist groups, Al-Qaeda and Taliban. Pantami had offered a public apology on the matter, saying he made the controversial comments in the past and that he was better informed and more mature now. This has not however drowned the voices of those calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to remove him from office. When State House Correspondents asked the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, if the issue was discussed at FEC, he said it was not discussed. Mohammed, who briefed journalists after the FEC meeting, was also asked if the Buhari-led Federal Government was comfortable with the burden on its image, occasioned by the Pantami issue. He, however, said he would not answer this particular question. “I’m not going to go into the issue of whether government is comfortable or not. I will answer your question directly. It was not discussed at the council meeting,” the Minister said.
