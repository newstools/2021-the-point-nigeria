 BY AGENCY REPORTER Former Nigerian striker Jonathan Akpoborie believes Super Eagles have the firepower to fly over their opponents at the group stage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. With all eyes on the 2022 World Cup qualifiers scheduled to commence by May after Gernot Rohr-led team’s qualification for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, Akpoborie insists that Nigeria will make a light walk of their opponents with the array of talents at the disposal of the coach. “Qualification for the 2022 World Cup won’t be much stressful for the Super Eagles considering the array of stars at Rohr’s disposal. “I quite agree that there is no minnow any longer in Africa going by what a team like Macedonia did to Germany. However, Nigeria will definitely want to make an early mark by picking quick points to feel comfortable in the group. “I really don’t see these teams stopping the Super Eagles regardless of who they parade because our players are more experienced and hungry for success,” he said.
