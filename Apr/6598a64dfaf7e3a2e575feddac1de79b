 BY NGOZI OKORIE MINISTER of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has appealed to all inmates that escaped from the Owerri Correctional Centre on Monday to return. While describing the Owerri jail break as the worst in recent history, he promised that fleeing inmates who voluntarily returned would be given amnesty. Aregbesola spoke during his visit to Imo State to inspect the level of damage done at the Owerri Correctional Centre. He decried the increasing attacks on correctional centres in recent times, while recalling the attacks on Edo, Ondo and Osun Custodial Centres during the #EndSARS protest. The Minister said the Federal Government would soon put in place adequate measures to protect the facilities. He, however, vowed that those who perpetrated the attack would be apprehended and prosecuted. “We will surely get them wherever they are,” he said. Aregbesola also ordered the relocation of the Owerri Recreational Club and other structures posing security threat to the premises of the Owerri Custodial Centre.
