 BY REBECCA AJANI FIVE persons have been kidnapped in Ajowa Akoko area of Ondo State. The five persons, who are members of the same family, had gone to Ondo State from Abuja to celebrate Easter, it was learnt. The kidnapped victims were identified as Ibrahim Olusa, his wife and three children. They were said to have been abducted between Ajowa Akoko and Ayere in Kogi State, on their way back to Abuja from Ondo. Family sources said the kidnappers had contacted the family, noting that they were demanding N10 million as ransom for the release of the victims. When the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Tee Leo lkoro, was contacted, he said the matter had not been reported to the state police headquarters. He however said he would contact the DPO of the area to get information on the matter. But the Commander of Amotekun in the state, Adetunji Adeleye, confirmed that he had been briefed about the abduction. Police detectives and Amotekun personnel have been deployed to the scene of the crime, according to findings. However, the immediate past Chairman of Ajowa Akoko community council, Ajayi Bakare, has said kidnapping and robberies on the Ajowa Ayere highway are as a result of the deplorable road. He appealed to Government to rehabilitate the road to enhance free flow of vehicles.
