 BY AGENCY REPORTER ARGENTINA’S President Alberto Fernandez, who has been vaccinated against COVID-19, announced late Friday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. “At the end of today, after presenting a fever of 37.3 (99 Fahrenheit) and a slight headache, I performed an antigen test, which was positive,” he tweeted. A PCR test later confirmed the diagnosis. The president, who turned 62 on Friday, was in isolation as a precaution but said he was “physically well.” “Although I would have liked to end my birthday without this news, I am also in good spirits,” he said. On Saturday he told Radio 750 that he has “no idea how I got infected.” “I am someone who takes very good care of myself. If it were not for the vaccine, I would be having a very bad time,” he said. Fernandez was inoculated with the Russian Sputnik V vaccine and had his second shot on February 11, sources in the presidency told AFP. Argentina is facing a second wave of the coronavirus with a sustained rise in cases. The South American country of 45 million inhabitants has recorded more than 2.3 million infections and over 56,000 deaths from Covid-19. More than 4.1 million people there had been vaccinated as of Saturday. – AFP
