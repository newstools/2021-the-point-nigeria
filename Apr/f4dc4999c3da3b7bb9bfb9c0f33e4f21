 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Nigeria captain Asisat Oshoala is set for a spell on the sidelines after undergoing surgery on her right foot on Tuesday, Barcelona FC revealed. The club however did not disclose the potential date she is expected to return to training as the former Arsenal and Liverpool striker is now racing against the clock to be fit for the crucial Champions League semifinal clash against the winners of the tie between Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon. Oshoala had been suffering from discomfort for a few weeks, which had caused her to miss the game against Santa Teresa on March 6. The operation was carried out by Dr. Dalmau under the supervision of FC Barcelona Medical Services. Oshoala is Barcelona’s second highest goalscorer in the Primera División Femenina with fifteen goals from twenty matches, including fourteen as a starter. The 26-year-old has scored in each of her last three matches in the Champions League, bringing her total to four in the competition this season.
