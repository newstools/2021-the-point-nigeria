 BY RIMI ALIU FORMER Minister of Information, Prof. Jerry Gana, has dumped the Social Democratic Party for his former party, main opposition Peoples Democratic Party. He returned to the PDP along with many of his supporters on Wednesday after three years. The former minister was received by key stakeholders of the party across the state and at the national level. While saying that there was no government in Nigeria, Gana, who had decamped from the PDP in March 2018, noted that the country needed urgent rescue. He spoke while addressing party members in Bida. “Today is not a day for lecture. It is not a day for campaigns. We just want to rejoice that we are back together solidly. And we are going to work together solidly; we are going to work together effectively; we are going to campaign powerfully,” Gana said. “I tell you, we are going to go around strategically, in such a way that the All Progressives Congress’ so-called government, whether in Niger State; is there a Government in Niger State? Many people are not aware, or at the centre? At the federal level, we don’t even have a Government,” he added.
