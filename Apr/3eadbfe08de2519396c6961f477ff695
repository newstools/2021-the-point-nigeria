 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE NATIONAL Broadcasting Commission has suspended Channels Television for allowing a leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra make inciting comments on its programme, contrary to the broadcast code. A fine of N5million has also been slammed against the TV station, which was accused of allowing its guest speaker to also make derogatory, false and misleading statements about the Nigerian Army, despite being proscribed by a court of law. This was contained in a letter to the Managing Director of Channels TV, signed by the Director-General, NBC, Prof. Armstrong Idachaba. The Commission based its action on the stationâ€™s 7pm live programme of Sunday, 25th April, 2021, saying Channels TV allowed the IPOB leader to make secessionist and inciting declarations on air without caution or reprimand.
