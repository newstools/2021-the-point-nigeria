 BY AGNES NWORI, ABAKALIKI A lecturer with the Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu Alike Ikwo (AE-FUNAI), Kyrian Nwoke, has been found dead in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital. It was learnt that his lifeless body was found near the popular Rice Mill with bullets wounds. He had gone to pick up some passengers with his car, which he was using for taxi services, when he reportedly met his untimely death. He had registered the car with an online car-hire service so as to make ends meet and take care of his young wife and child, it was gathered. His lifeless body was said to have been found the next day after he went to pick up some passengers, with bullet wounds, while his car was nowhere to be found. One of his colleagues who spoke to our correspondent, blamed his death on the Federal Government’s refusal to pay lecturers. The source said, “Kyrian Nwoke was a lecturer in the Physiology Department at Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu Alike, Nigeria. He was also a PhD student. “As a result of the hardship occasioned by the prolonged ASUU strike and FG’s withholding of lecturers’ salaries for over six months, he registered his car under the online taxi service to make ends meet. “On Sunday, January 10, he was called to go and pick customers at Udemezue Street, Abakaliki, and drop them at a popular eatery known for local delicacies at Ogoja road Abakaliki. “He never returned from that journey as his lifeless body with a bullet wound was discovered the next day near the Rice Mill along the same Ogoja road and his car missing. “That was how Kyrian Nwoke’s sun set at noon that faithful Sunday, leaving his wife a widow and his little daughter fatherless and AE-FUNAI bereft of a hardworking, upcoming Physiologist. The Security agents should do the needful and fish out the perpetrators of this dastardly act.” Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Loveth Odah, could not be reached for comment as of the time of filing this report.
