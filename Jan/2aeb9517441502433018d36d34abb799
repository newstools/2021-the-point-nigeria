 BY AYO ESAN THE Peoples Democratic Party has described the death of the Chairman of Akwa-Ibom State Chapter of the party, Obong Udo Ekpenyong, as devastating. The PDP, in a statement, signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said his death was a huge loss to the party and the nation as a whole. It said, “This is particularly
given his manifest sense of patriotism and resilience in the fight for the entrenchment of the democratic tenets of justice, equity, fairness, and good governance in our nation. “Obong Ekpenyong was an exceptionally dedicated administrator, an incomparable team player and grassroots mobilizer, who remained loyal to the ideals of the PDP and made innumerable contributions towards the stability, growth and success of our great party, at both the state and
national levels. “Alas, our nation has lost one of her bright lights. Udo Ekpenyong spared nothing in working in the interest of humanity as manifested in his selfless service as the Commissioner of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs and his sacrificial roles as our state Chairman in Akwa-Ibom
state.” The PDP deeply commiserated with Governor Udom Emmanuel for the loss of
Ekpenyong, who was his very close ally that played pivotal roles for the
success of his administration in the state. “Our party also commiserates with the Ekpenyong family, the PDP fold in Akwa-Ibom state, as well as the government and people of Akwa-Ibom state as we supplicate to God to give us the fortitude to bear this huge loss,” the party said.
