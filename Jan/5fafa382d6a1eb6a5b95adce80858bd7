The deputy governor added, “We also observed that a good number of these people were heavily armed, many of them with AK 47 riffle. “We have been able to apprehend a good number of them in a village called Kasima in Guma Local Government Area. “On January, 23, 156 cows belonging to these herdsmen were apprehended, and on the 26 of this month, another 220 cows were apprehended from the same vicinity. “It was observed that the herdsmen were not ordinary herdsmen because they were heavily armed.”
