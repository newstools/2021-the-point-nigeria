 BY AYO ESAN AS Nigerians struggle to acquire their National Identity Numbers from the offices of the National Identity Management Commission across the country, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said it had come to its knowledge that some unscrupulous persons were cashing in on the exercise to induce enrollees to sell their NIN for a fee. “The buyers of the numbers are also trading with them to persons whose motives are anything but noble,” the EFCC  said. The Commission warned Nigerians that it was not only illegal to sell their NIN, they also stood the risk of vicarious liability for any act of criminality linked to their NIN. “In other words, they risk arrest and prosecution for any act of criminality linked to their NIN whether or not they are directly responsible for such crimes,” the EFCC said. The Commission advised members of the public against selling their NIN and to report anyone seeking to buy same to the nearest office of the EFCC or other law enforcement agencies.
