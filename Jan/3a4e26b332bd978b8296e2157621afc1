 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE FORMER Vice President Atiku Abubakar has received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He is one of the few prominent world leaders who have received the vaccine. His media aide, Paul Ibe, confirmed some pictures earlier shared on Twitter by the Publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu, showing Atiku receiving the shot. “The importance of the COVID-19 vaccine in mitigating the effect of the coronavirus cannot be overstated, particularly in Africa and Nigeria. Yesterday (Wednesday), as part of the mass vaccination programme, His Excellency Atiku Abubakar received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,” Ibe said. THE POINT had reported that the Federal Government had said Nigeria would receive the coronavirus vaccine by January 2021. Minister of health, Osagie Ehanire, said a technical working group was working on which vaccine would best suit Nigeria, considering that the country had no -80 degrees freezers. “A technical working group is working on the question on vaccine. We have signed up with the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) for access to vaccines immediately they are available,” Ehanire said.
