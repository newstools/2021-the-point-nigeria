 BY SALIU SALIU THE Nigerian Army, on Wednesday, deployed 300 female soldiers to provide security on the Kaduna-Abuja highway. Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna State received the first batch of the troops, from the Nigerian Army Women Corps, at their Kakau base on the highway. They will complement the existing operations along the highways and the environs. El-Rufai said he was confident that, with the deployment of the female soldiers, the insecurity along the highways would soon be over, noting that the road would also be the safest in Nigeria. He expressed gratitude to the Nigerian Army for deploying the troops and reiterated the continued support of the Kaduna State Government in their bid to secure lives and property in the state. The Governor said, “The problem of Abuja-Kaduna road will be over with these female soldiers because what a man can do, a woman can do better. We believe in the capability of women in this State. “I am confident the road will be the safest in Nigeria. We will do everything possible to make this operation comfortable. We are very happy to have you. Your presence will inspire other girls to join the military. That is why we have female deputy governor to inspire other women.” The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division Nigerian Army, Kaduna, Maj.-Gen. Usman Mohammed, thanked Governor El-Rufai and his Deputy, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, for personally coming to receive the female troops.
