 BY SALIU SALIU THE Katsina State Police Command, on Wednesday, confirmed the arrest of the Vice Principal of a secondary school in Rimi Local Government Area of the state, for allegedly impregnating a 12-year-old student of the school. The Police said the VP, identified as brahim Tukur, usually took the said student to his house after school to have sex with her. The 12-year-old student, the Police said, had since been delivered of a baby allegedly fathered by the Vice Principal. Tukur, who is said to be married with three wives, was paraded at the Command headquarters on Wednesday, along with other suspects. The Command said all the suspects were arrested over rape-related offences between 9 and 14 January 2021. Spokesperson for the Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, told journalists that the rape incident involving the student had been reported at the Rimi Divisional Police headquarters by one Ibrahim Sani. “The Vice Principal who is married to three wives used to take the girl from the school to his house where he had serial sex with her. As a result, he got the girl impregnated and she was delivered of a baby through a Caesarian operation,” he said. Other suspects paraded – Auwal Hamzat and Sulaiman Abubakar – were said to have engaged in anal sex with three boys, who were children of their neighbours.
