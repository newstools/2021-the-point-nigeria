 A Customary Court sitting in Mapo in Ibadan, on Thursday, dissolved a 15-year-old marriage between a mother of two, Olubunmi Faseyitan, and her husband, Kolawole, over ”witchcraft” suspicion. President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade, dissolved the marriage after Faseyitan admitted that she asked a witch doctor to ”tie her husband spiritually to milk him dry”. Delivering judgment, Odunade, said, “Men and women intending to get married should seek God’s approval in their relationship before forging ahead.” He said that he dissolved the union in the interest of peace. The judge granted custody of the two children to Faseyitan. The arbitrator ordered Kolawole to pay N6,000 monthly for the children’s upkeep. Earlier, Faseyitan said, ”I never wished death on my husband. All I wanted was to put him in bondage and make him sick until he serves his purpose. ”I only told the witch doctor so that people would be convinced that his second wife was responsible for the calamity that befell him.” Earlier, Kolawole, a factory worker prayed for the dissolution of his 15-year-old marriage on grounds that his wife was into black magic. ”I did everything possible to please her. But it was not enough. I abandoned the home to her when she confessed to me,” he said. He tendered the recorded conversation between his wife and the alleged witch doctor as exhibit before the court. – NAN
