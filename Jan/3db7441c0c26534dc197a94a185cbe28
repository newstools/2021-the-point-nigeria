 BY REBECCA AJANI THE Ekiti State Government has begun the demolition of dilapidated and substandard structures in 532 primary schools across the state. This, it said, was in a bid to add aesthetic values to schools and rid them of miscreants. The Chairman of the State Universal Basic Education Board(SUBEB), Prof. Femi Akinwumi, disclosed this on Monday, in Ado Ekiti, while flagging off the demolition exercise at Mount Mary Nursery/Primary School, Oke Ila. He disclosed this just as the state government warned about 1,000 new primary school teachers employed by the current administration in the state to refrain from certificate and age falsifications. Anyone apprehended for such crime would be dismissed, the Government said. Akinwumi said, “Under this programme, all mud and substandard blocks must go down. We have to checkmate all the miscreants that are using those dilapidated buildings in all our primary schools as hideouts because we are aware some people used these places as abode. “Presently, we are training about 761 new teachers, which was a follow up to over 2,700 teachers that had been trained in 2020. We are giving a conducive environment and really enhancing the capacities of our personnel. “As professionals, we knew the importance and role good environments play in performances. It is a good variable in the performances of students in any examination.” “With this demolition and construction of new buildings, pupils can move around and enjoy the aesthetic environment we are going to provide without fear of attacks by hoodlums.They will also enjoy the beauty,” he added.
