 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board said, on Monday, that it had suspended two members of staff for violating COVID-19 protocols. The Board also banned two candidates from its processes for falling short of the same standards. This was disclosed in JAMB’s weekly bulletin published on its website. “Their suspension followed a surprise visit by the Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, to the Professional Testing Centre,” the Board said. The four individuals, according to the report, ran foul of the protocols when they refused to wear protective face masks provided to curtail the spread of COVID-19. JAMB said it had circulated various advisories on the need to adhere to extant protocols, noting that “these advisories were not only aimed at mitigating the risk of contagion for individual staff but also to safeguard the lives of their fellow staff.” “The suspension became necessary in order to send the right signal to all staff and clients alike that it (JAMB) will not tolerate any act that would expose people to unnecessary risks. The punitive action also underscored the seriousness with which the Board views adherence to COVID-19 protocols,” it stressed. But the report said the affected staff would still face the Board’s disciplinary committee, while their supervisors would be queried for negligence of duty. “The concerned staff would face the Board’s Disciplinary Committee. In addition, the Head of the Office under whose supervision the staff was working would also be queried for negligence and dereliction of duty for failure to adequately supervise the affected staff,” it said. The Board warned all its staff, nationwide, that it would not tolerate any violation of the extant protocols on COVID-19.
