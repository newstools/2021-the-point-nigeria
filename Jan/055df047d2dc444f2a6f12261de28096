 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE All Progressives Congress has said that its membership registration and revalidation exercise, scheduled to begin on Monday, remains on course. The party said the exercise would commence as earlier scheduled, describing a counter statement, said to have been signed by the Secretary, Caretaker/Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator James Akpanudoedehe, as “highly mischievous.” A terse statement signed by the same Secretary, CECPC, noted that any counter statement on the registration/revalidation exercise was fake. The statement read, “A ‘NOTICE’ in circulation and ascribed to the APC CECPC National Secretary, Sen. John J. AkpanUdoedeghe Ph.D. is fake and highly mischievous. “The APC membership registration, revalidation and update exercise remains on course and commences as scheduled in the attached timetable.” The National Secretary said, as earlier announced, the CECPC had approved the constitution of State Membership Registration Committees for the party’s nationwide membership registration, revalidation and update exercise. This, he said, would be followed by a train-the-trainer workshop.
