 BY REBECCA AJANI A traditional chief in Ibadan, identified as the Mogaji of Ori Aare compound, has been arrested for allegedly abusing two siblings. The Magaji, who escaped being lynched on Tuesday, was said to have tricked the female minors into his house and asked them to shave their pubic hair, after which he reportedly inserted his finger in their private parts in turns. It was learnt that he told the girls, aged 12 and 17, to bury the pubic hair around their house after he had packed it in a piece of paper and added pepper. He also reportedly warned them not to tell anyone about their experience. But the girls were said to have confided in their grandmother to take them to a spiritualist for possible antidote, fearing that they might have been used for rituals. Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps however saved the Magaji from being lynched and took him for interrogation. Spokesperson for the NSCDC, Oluwole Olusegun, said the suspect, however, claimed that the children had come to him for spiritual help.
