 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Super Eagles attacker Alex Iwobi has revisited the team’s disappointing 4-4 draw against Sierra Leone in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier staged at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City on November 13, 2020 and revealed how fans attacked the players after Sierra Leone draw with stones. With less than 30 minutes played, the Super Eagles were coasting to victory having scored four goals – the highest number of goals they have scored in a single half under Gernot Rohr – but let their healthy lead slip away as Kwame Quee pulled a goal just before half time, before goals from Alhaji Kamara and Mustapha Bundu in the second half. Iwobi was on a hat-trick having netted in the 4th and 27th minutes only for the Super Eagles to crumble against all expectations. The former Arsenal star has revealed for the first time ever that angry Super Eagles fans attacked the team bus after the draw as they made their way back to the hotel and one of the stones hit an unnamed player. “I can’t even tell you what happened in the game, I don’t know, it was mad,” Iwobi told reporters. “There was a lot of heated discussion in the changing room. The Nigerian Football President came in and said a few words. He was hurt, like all of us. “Trying to go back to the hotel, people were throwing stones at our bus. One cracked a window and hit a player. It was crazy. “They are proper passionate. I see where they were coming from, the result was hurtful. But we were almost physically hurt because of it!” Hopefully, Nigeria would qualify for the 2021 AFCON if they pick up two more points from their last two matches against Benin and Lesotho in March.
