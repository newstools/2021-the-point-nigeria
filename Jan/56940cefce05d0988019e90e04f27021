 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A combined team of security operatives on Monday rescued one of the kidnapped travellers in Osun State. It was gathered that gunmen had on Sunday night abducted some travellers along Omoh/Erin-Ijesha road, in Ori-Ade Local Government Area of Osun State. While the Corps Commander of Amotekun outfit, Osun State, Gen. Bashir Adewinbi, told our correspondent that the number of the victims was unclear, spokesperson of the Police in the state, Yemisi Opalola, said only two persons were kidnapped – a man and a woman. A police source said the kidnappers took the travellers to a nearby bush around Ori-Oke Omoh, while others were left at the scene. It was further gathered that the Police, operatives of the Nigerian Airforce, Amotekun corps officials, hunters and vigilante men, who were deployed to the busy road, rescued the man from the kidnappers. Opalola, while confirming the development, said the State Commissioner for Police, Wale Olokode, on Monday morning, had a meeting with the men of the Nigerian Airforce and leaders of the Amotekun corps, hunters and vigilante in the state to join the operation to rescue the abducted woman and to ensure an end to criminal activities in the state. “The CP has called the men of the Nigerian Airforce and leaders of Amotekun, hunters and vigilante to work together to rescue the woman and to put a stop to future kidnapping in the state,” Opalola said. Opalola added that effort was ongoing to rescue the remaining person in the hand of the kidnappers.
