 BY UMMU ABUBAKAR THE Kwara State Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ilorin, was thrown into panic and confusion on Monday when a director in the ministry, identified as Dr. Khalid Ibrahim Ndaman, was found dead in his office. His lifeless body was said to have been discovered by a staff in the ministry who had to go into his office for official reasons. Our correspondent gathered that when the staff knocked at the door and did not get a response, he decided to go inside, but met the late director resting his head on his table. “When he greeted him (the late Director), he did not answer. So the man said he went close to touch him. That was when he realised that he was dead and raised the alarm,” one of the workers at the ministry told our correspondent. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Kayode Okasanmi, who confirmed the incident, said the Police would consider it a case of sudden natural death for now until the conclusion of investigation.
