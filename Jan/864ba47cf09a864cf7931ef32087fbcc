 BY ABISOYE JOHNSON THE Police in Ogun State have arrested nine members of a notorious gang of land grabbers who had allegedly been terrorising the people of Agbogun Village, in Ewekoro Local Government Area of the state. Men of the Police Command stormed the village, following a distress call received at the Obada Oko Divisional headquarters from the Baale of the Village. The Baale, name not disclosed, said the land grabbers, who came from different areas of Ifo, Atan, Gasline and Sango Ota, had invaded the village and were violently attacking the people and extorting money. Spokesperson for the Command, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement. He listed the suspects to include Gbenga Odeniyi, Owolabi Shobayo, Michael Ramoni, Idowu Dauda and Femi Fadahunsi. Others, according to him, are Rasmus Hammed, Ade Lukman, Yakubu Akinwande and Sikiru Balogun. Oyeyemi said, upon the distress call from the Baale, the DPO Obada Oko Division, CSP Benard Ediagbonya, mobilised his patrol team to the scene where they met the suspects attacking one Mrs Oniyide Folashade and one Mrs Agbogun who were developing their sites. “On sighting the policemen, the hoodlums took to their heels but they were chased and nine amongst them were apprehended,” he added. The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered a massive manhunt for the rest of the hoodlums. He also warned land grabbers to stay clear of the state as the command under his watch would not tolerate any form of violence on the good people of the state from anyone or group no matter how highly placed.
