 BY REBECCA AJANI THE faction loyal to Senator Biodun Olujimi in the Ekiti State Peoples Democratic Party has declared that it will challenge the ruling of the Appeal Court, which affirmed the pro-Ayodele Fayose ward congresses, at the Supreme Court. This decision was communicated in a communique issued at the end of a stakeholders’ meeting in Ado-Ekiti, signed by the factional PDP State Public Secretary, Sanya Adesua. The faction also agreed that the State Working Committee, under the leadership of Hon Kehinde Odebunmi, should be sustained and encouraged to go ahead with the running of the party in the state. The Appeal Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti had, on Wednesday, dismissed an appeal filed by the Olujimi faction, protesting the judgment of a Federal High Court on the PDP ward congresses. Justice T. N Orji -Abadua upheld the decision of the trial court and ruled that the appellant’s case could not be justified because the matter emanated from intra-party affairs. The communique issued at the end of the meeting held by Olujimi’s loyalists read in part, “That all governorship aspirants are encouraged to go ahead with their consultation and mobilisation of the generality of Ekiti people, who are anxiously waiting for a PDP Governor in 2022. However, such sensitization must be devoid of rancour. “The meeting commended all our party members for their steadfastness and beliefs in the eventual triumph of Justice over Injustice, and truth over falsehood. forward ever, backward never.”
