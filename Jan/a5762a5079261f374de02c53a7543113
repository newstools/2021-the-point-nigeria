 BY NOGZI OKORIE GOVERNOR Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has vowed to use every lawful means to protect his territory from any form of unlawful invasion. The Governor also assured indigenes that his government would resist any expansionist agenda by outlawed groups or communities from neighbouring states. Ikpeazu made the declaration when he visited Akirika Obu Community, Ukwa East council area, in reaction to reports of invasion of the community by suspected criminals. He said, “Akirika Obu Community in Ukwa East LGA is a part and parcel of Abia State, and as such, my administration will take every lawful step to protect it from any form of unlawful invasion. “Every available space in the community will be well secured; the Military have come to stay in the community to ensure your safety and protection.” On the boundary dispute between the Akirika Obu Community and neighbours in Ika Council Area of the state, the Governor assured that the matter was already receiving the attention of the National Boundaries Commission. “Until a final determination is made, Akirika Obu community remains in Abia State and I will do my duty as Governor by ensuring that the status quo is maintained, especially that the lives and properties of the people are safeguarded,” he stressed. He urged the community to cooperate with the soldiers posted to the area, warning however against using the soldiers to resolve civil disputes amongst them.
