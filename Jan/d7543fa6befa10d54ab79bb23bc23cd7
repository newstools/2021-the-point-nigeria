 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE POPULAR Nollywood actor, Ernest Asuzu, is dead. He died on Tuesday evening at the age of 37. His wife, Jennifer Asuzu, confirmed the news to the media. Asuzu, who was preparing to return to Nollywood after some years of ill health, was said to have slumped on Tuesday evening and never woke up. He was bedridden with stroke in 2015, but said in December 2020, in an interview, that he was preparing to go back to acting, after surviving the illness which he said was spiritual. Asuzu began his acting career in the ’90s and rose to prominence after he starred in the 1997 Nollywood film, ‘Rituals’. He was also a musician with the name El Cream. He is survived by his wife and two children.
