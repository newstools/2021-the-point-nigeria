 The former Fifa president Sepp Blatter is reportedly in a stable condition after being admitted to a Swiss hospital. “My father is in hospital. He’s getting better every day. But he needs time and rest,” his daughter Corinne Blatter Andenmatten told Swiss newspaper Blick, which reported that the 84-year-old was in a serious but non-life-threatening condition. “On behalf of my family, I ask for privacy,” she added. This isn’t the first time Blatter has been hospitalised, with the Swiss suffering health problems in November 2015 and July 2016. Last month Fifa issued a complaint of “criminal mismanagement” against its former president. The complaint, which was sent to the Zurich prosecutor, related to the involvement of Blatter and other former officials at the world governing body in the Fifa museum project in the Swiss city. Blatter vehemently denies wrongdoing. “The accusations are baseless and are vehemently repudiated,” his lawyer Lorenz Erni said. Blatter is already under criminal investigation in Switzerland over a separate matter – an alleged undue payment to the former Uefa president Michel Platini. He was issued an initial eight-year ban from football by Fifa’s ethics committee in relation to that payment which was reduced to six years on appeal. That sanction was upheld by the court of arbitration for sport. Platini and Blatter have continued to maintain they did nothing wrong.
