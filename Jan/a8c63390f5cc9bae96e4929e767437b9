 BY AYO ESAN PRIMATE Elijah Ayodele of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Lagos, has said that the two major political parties in the country, the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, will jettison the gentleman agreement on zoning of the presidency come 2023. Ayodele, who spoke exclusively with THE POINT and who is reverred for annual predictions of events of a new year, said the aspirations of the Igbos to win 2023 presidency was just a dream. He said, “Both parties, the APC and the PDP, will not respect the gentleman agreement of zoning of the presidency. There will be a hidden agenda that will work against the zoning of the presidency to the South in 2023. “The zoning will not be realistic, and apart from this, there will be many arguments against this zoning and that is how the presidency will elude the Igbos in 2023. “Those aspiring for the presidency among the Igbos will fall midway, though initially, a strong group will come up and speak loudly for Igbo presidency.” On the 2021 Anambra State Governorship election, Primate Ayodele said the election would generate serious tension but that the race was between the PDP and the All Progressives Grand Alliance. Noting that the Year 2021 would be a better year, he said, “It will be a year of the Lord in which the people will humble themselves before the Almighty God. The international community will also assist Nigeria in the fight against Boko Haram insurgency.”
