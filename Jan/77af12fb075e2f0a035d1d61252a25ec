 BY AYO ESAN THE African Democratic Congress has congratulated former Ambassador of Nigeria to the United States, Prof. George Obiozor, on his emergence as President-General of the Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo. The party also congratulated Amb. Okey Emuchay, the new Secretary-General of the Group, saying with the election of Obiozor as President-General, the outgoing leader, Nnia Nwodo, had finished well. The National Chairman of ADC, Chief Ralphs Okey Nwosu, in a statement on Tuesday, said Obiozor’s election was duly deserved and called on Igbo indigenes, at home and in the Diaspora, to give him the support needed to advance the socio-economic development of the zone. Nwosu, who is also the acting President of the Inter-Party Advisory Council, Nigeria, said with Obiozor’s enviable track record, exposure and proven integrity, the affairs of Ohanaeze Ndigbo were in safe hands. “Both the new President-General and Ambassador Okey Emuchay, who emerged as Secretary General, will employ their deep knowledge of diplomacy and government to negotiate a place of worth for Ndigbo in the new Nigeria project,” Nwosu said. He said Nigeria was at a point in its Democratic history where zones must be properly positioned to exploit their unique human and natural resources as catalysts for central growth and unity with a view to making Nigeria’s diversity more robust. “This can only be achieved when those who have the capacity and sound knowledge of people and credentials in nation building pilot affairs at these levels,” Nwosu stressed. He congratulated Ndigbo for the choice of Obiozor and wished the new Executives a peaceful reign. ADC Chairman concluded that with these types of quality leaders taking over, Chief Nnia Nwodo has finished well, noting that his team had succeeded in handing over to a top quality leadership to navigate Ohanaeze’s affairs moving forward.
