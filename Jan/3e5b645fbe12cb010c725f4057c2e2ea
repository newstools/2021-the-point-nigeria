 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE University of Lagos has announced January 25, 2021 as resumption date for online classes. The date was released in the University’s revised academic calendar for the first semester of the 2019/2020 academic session. The semester, according to the calendar, will end on April 1, 2021, barring unforseen events. Students in Nigeria’s public universities have been away from school for almost 10 months, owing to the protracted strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities in March 2020. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has however led to another controversy over whether the January 18, 2021 resumption date announced by the Federal Government is safe, in view of rising cases. ASUU called off its strike on December 24, 2020, but academic activities have yet to resume.
