 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE PUBLISHER of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, and four other activists have been remanded in Kuje Correctional Center. This is pending when their formal bail application will be heard on Tuesday, January 5, 2020. Sowore was arrested along with the other activists for leading a “crossover protest” in Abuja and arraigned on three-count charges of conspiracy, unlawful assembly and incitement. Sowore, who was the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress in the 2019 election, denied all charges. A Magistrate’s Court sitting in Wuse Zone 2, Abuja, however ordered his remand, alongside others, in Kuje prison. The Magistrate, Mabel Segun-Bello, ruling on the oral bail application, said all the charges were bailable, unless they would evade trial or commit the same offence.
