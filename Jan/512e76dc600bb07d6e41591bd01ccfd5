 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A 26-year-old woman, Fikayo Makinde, was, on Thursday, arraigned before an Osun Magistrateâ€™s Court sitting in Ile-Ife for allegedly failing to refund the money she borrowed from her fellow traders. The Police Prosecutor, Inspector Sunday Osanyintuyi, told the court that the defendant allegedly defrauded two women to the tune of N5.4 million between March 2019 and July 2019 at Lagere, Ile-Ife. Osanyintuyi said that Fikayo obtained cash sum of N4,770,000 from one Oyetade James with pretence to use the money for business and refund. He added that the defendant converted the cash into her own use. According to him, the defendant also obtained cash sum of N630,000 from one Funke Akingboye with pretence  to use the money for business before paying it back. But the prosecutor argued that Fikayo failed to refund the said N630,000 to Akingboye after doing the said business. Osanyintuyi explained that the offence contravened sections 383 (2) (f), 390(9) and 419 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2002. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the four-count charge of fraud and convertion levelled against her. Her counsel, Mr Babawale Omodogbe, applied for bail in simple terms and promised the court that Fikayo would furnish the court with reliable sureties. Magistrate A. A. Adebayo granted the bail of the defendant in the sum of N1 million with one surety in like sum. Adebayo added that the sureties must swear to affidavit of means, reside within the court jurisdiction with proof of land ownership. The case was adjourned till March 3, 2021.
