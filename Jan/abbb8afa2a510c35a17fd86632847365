 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Police in Osun State have arrested a 200-level student, Usman Muyideen, and his Fulani herdsman friend, Isa Memudu, for allegedly kidnapping and murdering two boys. The victims – Thompson Onibokun, aged 13; and Samson Onibokun, 12, were said to be Muyideen’s nephews. Muyideen, a student of Kwara State University, is a younger brother of one of the victims’ father. The undergraduate and Memudu were said to have kidnapped the teenage boys on Monday and demanded N25 million from their parents as ransom. The victims were kidnapped at Iludun Area of Osogbo, Osun State, according to the Police. Speaking with journalists while being paraded by police at the Osun State Police headquarters in Osogbo on Friday, Muyideen, an indigene of Iragbiji, said, “One of them (victims) is my elder brother’s son, while the other is my brother’s stepson. “I called them and took them on a motorcycle. We took them to a place inside the bush at Coker village.” “I was the one who called their father for ransom. We left them in the bush and went there to feed them. “We were not there when they died. So we stopped going there, and I stopped calling their father,” Muyideen told newsmen. Also confessing to the crime, Memudu said that he was the one who found the village. “We took them to a bush in Coker village and we were there for four days. I know the bush because I always take cows to graze around the area. “For four days, we fed the children with bread and Big Cola. I wanted to use the ransom to start a business. “The boys died when they were trying to struggle out of the rope,” he said. The Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, said the remains of the victims had been deposited at the morgue of Osun State University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo for autopsy.
