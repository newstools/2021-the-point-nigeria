 TWO ex-convicts, released only two months ago from a Correctional Centre, have been arrested by police in Anambra for yet another robbery case. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), CSP Haruna Mohammed, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday in Awka. Mohammed said the police, in collaboration with a community vigilance group, arrested the suspects on Jan. 22 at about 9:10pm, at Umueri in Anambra East Local Government Area. The police spokesman identified the suspects as Anthony Okeke, 29; and Chijioke Eljiaja, 23, noting that the suspects were also from the same community they were terrorising. “Exhibit recovered in their possessions include one locally-made revolver pistol and six cartridges. “They will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded,” Mohammed said.
