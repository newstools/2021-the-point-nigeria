 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE GENERAL Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has denied reports that the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, ordered his probe over allegations that he slept with the wife of a former pastor in his church, Mike Davids, and also threatened his life. Suleman was also said to have allegedly denied the pastor access to his children. He said the public should disregard the report despite a letter, dated January 5, 2021, confirming the probe directive by the IGP, addressed to the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Force Intelligence Bureau, Garki. “IGP orders probe on me? Where, when? Maybe my ghost. Just reading stories now. Please discard. There is no such thing,” Apostle Suleman tweeted via his verified handle @APOSTLESULEMAN, on Monday. The IGP’s letter, referenced, “CB:7000/IGP.SEC/ABJ/Vol.515/561”, was signed by the Principal Staff Officer II to the Inspector-General of Police, ACP Iliya Doma. The letter, titled, ‘Re: Criminal Petition Against Apostle Johnson Suleman for Enticement of a Married Woman; Adultery; Unlawful Criminal Restraint to Access Children and Threat to Life’, read in part, “I attach herewith a copy of a letter dated December 30, 2020 with its attachments received from V.C Ezenagu & Associates on the above-underlined subject. “The Inspector-General of Police directs that you treat. Accept the assurances of my esteemed regards please.”
