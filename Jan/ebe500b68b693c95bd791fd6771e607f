 Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola handed German-born midfielder of Nigerian descent Felix Nmecha his FA Cup debut as the Citizens moved into the fourth round of the competition with an emphatic 3-0 win over Birmingham City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Nmecha’s two previous appearances for Manchester City’s first team came against Burton Albion in the League Cup back in January 2019 and Olympiakos in the Champions League two months ago. Man City were comfortably leading 3-0 before half time thanks to a brace from Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden’s strike. With the job all but done, Guardiola made three changes at the break, bringing on Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Felix Nmecha and John Stones to replace Ruben Dias, Kevin De Bruyne and Joao Cancelo respectively. Nmecha looked nervy in his opening minutes on the pitch but improved as the game progressed. The 2000-born attacking midfielder was in red-hot form in his last six games for Manchester City in the Premier League 2, scoring three goals and providing an assist. Nmecha has earned caps for England and Germany’s youth teams and remains eligible to play for the Super Eagles through his father. Manchester City will discover their next opponents in the FA Cup when the draw for the fourth and fifth rounds takes place on Monday evening.
