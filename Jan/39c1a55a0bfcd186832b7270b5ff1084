 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE A former Presidential Spokesman under the Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan administrations, Doyin Okupe, has reacted to his son’s revelation of his gay status, saying he has been aware of the situation for a while. He said he foresaw a major challenge ahead, but that he was confident that with God, the whole saga would end up in praise. Okupe, a Nigerian physician, was reacting, in a series of tweets, to a viral photo in which his son, Bolu, was wearing rainbow boxers with the inscription, “Yes, I am gay”. He condemned homosexuality in the strongest terms, saying, “I am vehemently opposed to homosexuality as it runs contrary to the avowed precepts of my Christian faith.” Okupe tweeted, “I have been aware of this his new orientation for a while now. He knows that as a Christian and a witness for Christ (an evangelist), I am vehemently opposed to homosexuality as it runs contrary to the avowed precepts of my Christian faith. “For me, I look beyond the surface or the physical. Here I see a major spiritual challenge ahead but I know as my God liveth, this whole saga will end up in praise to the Almighty Jehovah who I serve day and night. “For it is written: Behold, the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save, neither is His ear dead that he cannot hear. Isaiah 59 vs 1.”
