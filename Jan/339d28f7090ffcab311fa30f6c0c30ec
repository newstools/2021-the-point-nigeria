 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE University of Lagos has refuted reports that returning students will pay N50,000 each for online lectures and examinations. Describing the information as false, the institution advised stakeholders to always access verified information about UNILAG on its official website – www.unilag.edu.ng. It said this just as it, again, confirmed that lectures would commence online on Monday, January 25, 2021. These were contained in a press statement posted on UNILAG’s official website, titled, “Disclaimer: UNILAG resumption is absolutely free”. The statement said, “The Management of University of Lagos wishes to inform all students, parents and the general public, that a notice on the internet purporting that returning students of the University of Lagos are to pay a sum of ₦50,000 for online lectures and examinations, is FALSE and should be disregarded. “All students are to commence online lectures on Monday, January 25, 2021, at absolutely NO COST.” “In the future, it is advised that our esteemed stakeholders and interested individuals kindly check the official University of Lagos website (www.unilag.edu.ng) and official social media platforms for verified information about the University,” it added.
