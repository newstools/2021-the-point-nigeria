 BY NGOZI OKORIE THE Police in Anambra State have arrested a man, identified as Chukwuemeka Obijofa, for allegedly killing his wife and four-year- old child in Ofufe Nza Village, Ekwusigo Local Government Area of the state. The suspect, 28, was said to have attacked his wife, Chisom; and four-year-old daughter, Amanda, on their heads with a shovel, in circumstances yet to be ascertained. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Haruna Mohammed, who confirmed the incident, said the suspect had been arrested and the corpses of the deceased deposited at the morgue of the joint hospital, Ozubulu. Mohammed said, “On the 26/1/2021 at about 7:45pm, Police operatives attached to Ozubulu Police Station, arrested one Chukwuemeka Obijofa, ‘m’, aged 28 years, of Ofufe Nza village in Ekwusigo LGA of Anambra State. “Suspect allegedly ran amok in circumstances yet to be ascertained and attacked his wife, one Chisom Chukwuemeka, ‘f’, aged 26 years, and own child, named Amanda Chukwuemeka, ‘m’, aged 4 years, both of same address, with a shovel on their heads.” According to him, the suspect also used the same object to injure a vigilante operative who tried to rescue the victims. He added, “Police detectives visited the scene and rushed the victims to the joint hospital, Ozubulu, for medical attention where the two victims were certified dead by a medical doctor on arrival. “The wounded vigilante is responding to treatment, while the corpses of the victims were deposited at the hospital’s morgue for autopsy.” The PPRO, however, said the Commissioner of Police, John Abang, had directed the DPO to transfer the case to State CID, Awka, for discreet investigation to unravel the actual cause of the incident.
