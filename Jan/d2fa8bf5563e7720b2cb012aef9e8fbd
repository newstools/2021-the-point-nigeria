 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI MEMBER representing Ezza South/Ikwo Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, Chinedu Ogah, has called on the Federal Ministry of Education to correct the imbalance on the list of the visitation panels to Federal Universities and Inter University centres across the country, released by the Federal Ministry of Education. Ogah, while addressing newsmen, lamented the alleged shortchanging of Professors from Ebonyi State with regard to the said list, noting that the state had produced professors of international repute to merit the list. He also alleged that professors Ikenna Onyindo and Kelvin N. Nwogu, who were penciled under Ebonyi State on the list were from Anambra and Imo states respectively. Ogah called on the Minister of Education to urgently correct the anomaly and include genuine Ebonyi people to guarantee equity, fair play and justice. He expressed dissatisfaction with the Committee that compiled the list, noting that no matter the criteria used in the selection process, glorifying two non-Ebonyians to represent Ebonyi State in the list was not only criminal but an affront to the sensibility of every right thinking Nigerian. He said, “The list released by the Federal Ministry of Education as panels to visit all the Federal Universities across the country, shortchanging two Ebonyi people, depicts a calculated attempt to trample down the equity and fairness President Buhari’s administration was built on. “I challenge the purported Ebonyians in the list to tender their Local Government Identification letter before the public to vindicate themselves.”
