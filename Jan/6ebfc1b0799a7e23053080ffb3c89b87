 BY REBECCA AJANI SOUTH-WEST chairmen of the Peoples Democratic Party have said they will have nothing to do with what they described as a factional reconciliation committee, headed by former Governor of Osun State, Olagunsoye Oyinlola. They therefore advised Oyinlola not to soil his name by pursuing some persons’ agenda all in the name of reconciliation. They based their stand on an allegation that the reconciliation committee was not set up by legitimate Executives of the South West Zonal Caretaker Committee, and could not be trusted by members of the party. They however reiterated their support for the Femi Babalola-led reconciliation committee, saying the committee would work in collaboration with the National Reconciliation Committee. These positions were made known in a statement signed by the Chairman of the State Chairmen, Sikirulai Ogundele, on Sunday. Ogundele is the Chairman of the PDP in Ogun State. He said the fact that the chairmen attended a meeting held at the Ibadan, Oyo State residence of former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, did not connote acceptance of the Oyinlola-led committee. The state chairmen accused Oyinlola of running errands for Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, and advised him to redeem his image. “Prince Oyinlola needs to respect his name and stop running around in the name of a reconciliation committee that is tailored by the person who set it up to work to predetermined answers,” Ogundele said. He added, “More so that Dr Saka Balogun, the man that Governor Makinde made Secretary of the Committee is his close ally and we are aware of what he told a leader of the party in Oyo State after our meeting in Ibadan recently. “It is therefore our advice that the two leaders should consider their name and quit that reconciliation committee set up by Governor Makinde because he who pays the piper will definitely dictate the tunes.”
