 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit said, on Monday, that it had obtained a court order authorising it to publicly auction 88 vehicles whose drivers were arrested for driving against traffic in different parts of the state. The affected vehicles, which were impounded by the enforcement team of the agency, were forfeited by Lagos State Mobile Court, in line with Part (3), item (27) of the Lagos State Transport Sector Reformed Law, 2018, it said. The development was disclosed in a statement by the Head, Public Affairs Unit of the agency, Adebayo Taofiq. The Chairman of the Agency, CSP Shola Jejeloye, was quoted to have said that the Public Auction would hold in line with COVID-19 protocols on Wednesday, January 20, 2021, at the Agency’s Car Park, (Behind Shoprite), Alausa, Ikeja. The CP warned motorists, both private and commercial bus drivers, to desist from driving against traffic, maintaining that any vehicle impounded would be forfeited. “The penalty is outright forfeiture of such vehicle to the government without any option of fine,” he stressed. Jejeloye added that the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, had directed the operatives of the Agency to continue prosecuting traffic offenders until sanity is restored on Lagos roads “and law-abiding citizens are allowed to commute without being impeded by unlawful individuals.”
