 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE FORMER Presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, has withdrawn his case against the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Twitter International Company, Jack Dorsey, which he filed in the heat of the #EndSARS crisis in Nigeria. Garba had accused the Twitter CEO of sponsoring the #EndSARS protests and prayed the court to stop the company from operating in any part of Nigeria. He had instituted a $1bn suit against Dorsey at the Federal High Court, Abuja. But he disclosed, via his Twitter handle on Monday, that he had written to his lawyers to withdraw the case, appealing to Nigerians who might have been offended by his action to forgive him. “I think the action has served its purpose. I’ve written to our lawyers to withdraw the case from court. I also tendered my sincere apologies to Nigerians who are pained by my #EndSARS actions. Nigeria shall rise,” Garba tweeted. The former presidential aspirant, who is the Chief Executive Officer of IPI Group Limited, filed the suit in question on October 20, through his lawyer, Abbas Ajiya. He said this was “to enforce his fundamental rights pursuant to Provisions of Order II Rules 1, 2, and 3 of the Fundamental Rights Rules 2009, Sections 34(1), 35(1), 41(1), 43 and 46(1) and 2 of the 1999 Constitution and Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12(1) of the African Charter on Human and People’s’ Rights Act CAP.
