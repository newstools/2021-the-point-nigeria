BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Super Eagles hopeful Ike Ugbo has won CercleBrugge’s Goal of the Month award for December 2020, according to the Belgian First Division A club on their official website. The former England U17 international bagged a brace against RSC Charleroi on December 15 but the second of his two goals was nominated for the award. In the 25th minute, the Chelsea loanee made it 2-1 with a fantastic right-footed shot after the Charleroi goalkeeper had raced out of his goal. Ugbo polled 46 percent of the votes to beat off competition from Anthony Musaba who also found the net in the same match against RSC Charleroi. CercleBrugge supporter MaaikeDubruque won a CAPS Fuel Card worth €60 for participating in the poll. Ugbo has directly participated in eleven goals (10 goals, 1 assist) in 18 league matches so far this season after setting up Musaba’s goal in the 89th minute of CercleBrugge’s 1-1 draw with Beerschot on Wednesday evening.
