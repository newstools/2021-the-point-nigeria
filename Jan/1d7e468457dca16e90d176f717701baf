 BY AYO ESAN THE Department of State Services has alerted the Nigerian public about alleged plans by those it described as elements working with external forces to incite religious violence across the country. In a release signed by its Public Relations Officer, Peter Afunanya, the DSS listed the target states to include Sokoto, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Rivers, Oyo, Lagos and South East states. The DSS said, “Part of the plans is to cause inter-religious conflicts as well as use their foot soldiers to attack some worship centres, religious leaders, personalities, key and vulnerable points. ” Consequently, Nigerians are advised to be wary of these antics and shun all divisive tendencies aimed at inciting or setting them against one another.” While the Service pledged to collaborate with sister agencies to ensure that public order is maintained, it warned those hatching these plots to desist from such in the interest of peace, security and development of the country.
