 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Nigeria international Peter Olayinka is on the radar of Bayer Leverkusen in the January transfer window. Bayer Leverkusen are in the market for a winger as they have only three players in that department – Moussa Diaby, Leon Bailey and Karim Bellarabi. The Bundesliga club have on their wishlist Nordsjaelland’s Kamaldeen Sulemana and Slavia Prague’s Peter Olayinka. Bayer Leverkusen have a dossier on the Nigerian attack-minded player as he netted the winner against them in the group stage of this season’s Europa League. Last summer, VfB Stuttgart were priced out of a deal for the 25-year-old, with Slavia Prague demanding ten million euros for their number 9. Olayinka is tied to the Czech champions until June 30, 2023, having extended his contract with the club last month. He had stops at KF Skënderbeu, SV Zulte Waregem, FK Dukla Prag and FK Bylis Ballsh before joining Slavia Prague in the summer of 2018. Meanwhile, Super Eagles defender Bryan Idowu has reportedly agreed a permanent deal with Russian Premier League club Khimki. According to reports the left-back will ink a permanent deal with Khimki with effect from June 2021. The Russian-born Idowu has a contract with Lokomotiv Moscow until the end of the 2020-2021 season, paving the way for him to join Khimki has a free agent in the summer. He was loaned out to the Red-Backs for the entirety of this season as he was not guaranteed first team opportunities at the Railway Men. A member of the Super Eagles squad to the 2018 World Cup, Idowu has not figured for the national team for more than two years, with his last appearance coming in a goalless draw with Uganda back in November 2018. In the current season, the 28-year-old has been involved in 17 league matches for Khimki and was on target in back-to-back games against Spartak Moscow and Rostov.
