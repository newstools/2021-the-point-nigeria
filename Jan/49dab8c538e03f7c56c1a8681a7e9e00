 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE MANY streets in Coker-Aguda, Surulere Local Government Area of Lagos State, have been deserted by panic-stricken residents, following a bloody clash between rival cult groups in the area. No fewer than three persons were reportedly killed when members of the Aye and Black Axe cult groups went wild in the area, armed with guns, cutlasses, broken bottles and other dangerous weapons. The pandemonium began on Saturday night into Sunday morning with many residents gripped with fear and unable to leave their houses. The affected streets were Willy Omiyi, Akinyele, Enitan and Adetola, among others. “The gunshots sounds were deafening. We locked ourselves in while we told people who were not yet in the area to stay where they were. I learnt that about three people had been killed but we don’t know which cult they belong to,” a resident who pleaded anonymity told our correspondent. Two of the cultists who were said to be members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers had reportedly been killed on Saturday. A member of the rival cult group, said to be an Oodua Peoples Congress member, was also killed in a reprisal attack on Sunday. He was said to have been killed at his security post. Residents of Surulere have called on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to urgently find a lasting solution to the issue of incessant rival cult clashes in the area. They also urged the Police Command to initiate a manhunt for members of the rival cult groups for peace to return to Coker-Aguda.
