 BY AYO ESAN NATIONAL Publicity Secretary of Pan-Yoruba Socio-Political Group, Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin, said, on Sunday, that the group had appealed to Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, to allow state actors under Governor Seyi Makinde to deal with the issue of insecurity and allegations against herdsmen in the state. He, however, said Afenifere was aware of the atrocities of the Fulani in Oyo State and other South West states. Odumakin said, “We did not say this because we do not understand the crimes some of the herders are committing daily, but the Yorubas would say: we learn how to state our case before we engage in a fight. “We were at the forefront of calling out the Coalition of Northern Group when they asked Igbos to vacate the North without committing any crime and we should be constant by appealing to groups and individuals who are unhappy with the murderous activities of some Fulani herders in Yorubaland to use all the available tacts in dealing with the matter even in the face of total irresponsibility of the Federal Government to wanton destruction of lives and property.” Also speaking on the crisis, former Presidential candidate and former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Kingsley Moghalu, said the confrontation between herdsmen and state authorities in the South West called for a decisive action on the lingering issue. He said there was a need to ensure security and regard for the law by the herdsmen. Moghalu called for dialogue and an inclusive approach “that avoids broad ethnic stereotyping and blind ethnic loyalty.”
