 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE GOVERNOR Babajide Sanwo-Olu has cancelled the ongoing process for the appointment of a Vice-Chancellor for the Lagos State University. The Governor, who is the Visitor to the University, said the cancellation of process followed thorough investigation and stakeholders engagement necessitated by various petitions against the ongoing selection process. Sanwo-Olu therefore directed that a fresh process, which would terminate in 45 days, should commence immediately. The outgoing Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, has also been directed to convene an emergency Senate meeting to appoint one of the Deputy Vice-Chancellors, who is not a candidate in the cancelled selection process as Acting Vice-Chancellor from Monday, January 11, 2021. These decisions were disclosed in a statement on Friday, signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Gboyega Akosile, titled, “Sanwo-Olu cancels ongoing appointment of LASU VC, orders fresh process”. “Governor Sanwo-Olu was inundated with petitions arising from the selection process of the Vice-Chancellor by the Governing Council. After a thorough evaluation and investigation of the various complaints, Mr. Governor, in his capacity as the Visitor to the University ordered the cancellation of the process,” the statement said. “The outgoing Vice-Chancellor, Professor Olanrewaju Fagbohun, has also been directed to convene an emergency Senate meeting for the purpose of appointing one of the Deputy Vice-Chancellors, who is not a candidate in the cancelled selection process as Acting Vice-Chancellor from Monday, January 11, 2021, when the tenure of the incumbent Vice-Chancellor, Professor Fagbohun expires,” it added. The Governor further directed that the Senate should select among its members, “a pro tem chairman to superintend the meeting and conduct of the election of Acting Vice-Chancellor.”
