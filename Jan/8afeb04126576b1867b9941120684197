 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE CHAIRMAN of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Kayode Fayemi, has said the ultimatum given by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to herdsmen illegally occupying forest reserves in the state was misrepresented in the media. He said the governor did not order herdsmen to vacate the state. Fayemi spoke at a meeting with the leadership of Miyetti Allah on Akeredolu’s quit notice, which expired on Monday. ”The order of the Ondo State Governor was misconstrued and misrepresented by a section of the media. He only ordered those occupying the Forest Reserves in Ondo State illegally to quit,” Fayemi said. The Governors of Ondo, Osun, Ekiti, Oyo, Jigawa, and Kebbi states were present at the meeting. Fayemi had said, in his opening remarks, that the meeting was called to resolve the issue of insecurity in the South-West. “Many members of MACBAN were born in the South-West. So, Akeredolu cannot ask Fulani to vacate Ondo State. The area concerned is the forest reserves and it is about registration and also to work in line with the law,” he said. “What we are after is the criminals, not Fulani herdsmen. Criminals are criminals irrespective of their ethnic group,” the Governor declared.
