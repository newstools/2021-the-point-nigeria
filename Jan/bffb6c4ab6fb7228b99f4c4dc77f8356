 BY SALIU SALIU, KANO THE Kano State Government has stopped the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to workers in the state. The Governor Abdullahi Ganduje administration hinged the development on economic recession, which it said, had reduced its earnings. Kano State, based on this announcement, will now revert to the old minimum wage of N18,000. Special Adviser to the Governor on Media, Salihu Tanko Yakasai, disclosed these to journalists on Wednesday. “The state government has stopped the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to its workers with immediate effect. The state is unable to continue paying N30,000 because what the state is currently getting as a government has reduced,” he stated. “The state government has reverted to the initial minimum wage due to the recession. What we are getting now as a government has reduced, and we can’t afford to pay the N30,000 minimum wage,” he added. The Kano State Government had commenced the payment of N30,000 minimum wage in December 2019. The letter conveying the agreement to begin the payment had read in part, ”Government has agreed to commence the payment of the new minimum wage effective from December, 2019, while arrears of April-November, 2019, will be settled in installments.”
