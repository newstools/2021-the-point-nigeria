 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Queens Park Rangers star Bright Osayi-Samuel has landed in Istanbul to complete the formalities of his transfer to Turkish Super Lig side Fenerbahce. The Anambra State-born winger had agreed to join the Yellow Canaries on a four-year contract with effect from the summer but the move has been brought forward. Osayi-Samuel arrived at the Atatürk Airport General Aviation Terminal on Tuesday morning and will sign a four-and-a-half-year deal subject to a traditional medical before his unveiling. The 23-year-old is set to become the sixth Nigerian-born player to feature for Fenerbahce’s first team after Uche Okechukwu, Austin Okocha, Emmanuel Emenike, Joseph Yobo and Victor Moses. He departs Queens Park Rangers after three years and five months, making 115 appearances in all competitions while scoring 13 goals and providing the same number of assists. Osayi-Samuel was a fans favourite at Queens Park Rangers, winning the Young Player of the Year and Goal of the Season prizes for 2019-2020.
