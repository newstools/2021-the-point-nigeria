 Nigeria-eligible youngster Armstrong Okoflex made his debut for Scottish Premiership giants Glasgow Celtic as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Hibernian on Monday night. Celtic were faced with a coronavirus crisis before the match at Celtic Park with several first team players self-isolating upon their return from a mid-season training camp in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. As many as thirteen first team players were unavailable for the fixture against Hibernian, so stand-in manager Gavin Strachan in the absence of Neil Lennon and John Kennedy promoted from within. Wearing the number 48 on the back of his jersey, Okoflex came off the bench to replace Cameron Harper in the 61st minute for his professional debut. The 18-year-old joined Celtic in the summer of 2018 after turning down a scholarship offered to him by Arsenal. His first ever squad involvement before the match against Hibernian was against Kilmarnock on February 17, 2019 and he was also non-playing substitute against Heart of Midlothian three months later. Okoflexâ€™s contract with Celtic runs out in June 2021 and he has attracted interest from Premier League side Crystal Palace. Meanwhile, Championship club Queens Park Rangers have announced that Nigerian striker Aramide Oteh has been recalled from his loan spell at League Two side Stevenage. If the two clubs had honoured the initial agreement, the 22-year-old would have remained at the Boro until the end of the 2020-2021 campaign. Oteh went on to make 17 appearances for Stevenage in all competitions, scoring four goals. He previously spent time on loan at Football League clubs Walsall and Bradford. In 21 matches for Queens Park Rangers first team, the last of which came against Plymouth in the Carabao Cup back in September, he has scored two goals and totaled 668 minutes. Stevenage currently sit 22nd in the League Two, with 20 points from 20 matches.
