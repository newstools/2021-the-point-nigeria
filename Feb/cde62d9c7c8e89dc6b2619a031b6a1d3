 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts has summoned the Group Managing Director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, over the Auditor-General of the Federation’s query on an alleged N3.878 trillion unremitted revenue from sales of domestic crude oil. Kyari is expected to appear on February 11, 2021, alongside those who benefited from the Nigeria Gas Limited Funding Account. The beneficiaries include Century Energy Service Limited; United Refining Rachmann; Union Petroleum Service; Ocean Bed Trading Limited; Ice Energy & Petroleum; Mangrove Pet. Supplies & Logistic and Unicorp Trading Limited. The NNPC GMD, who was invited in a two-page letter, referenced, ‘HR/PAC/SCO5/9NASS/FA/2015/1’ dated February 1, 2021, was asked to appear before the Committee with the management of National Petroleum Investment Management Services. The lawmakers will require Kyari to respond to queries involving the non-collection of miscellaneous gas receipt in 2015, refund of N450billion by NNPC to the Federation Account; and refund of N1.8 trillion unpaid gas revenue without details, among others. They are also investigating a payment of $30,963,894.01 (N16,099,887,119.77) made through the Nigeria Gas Limited Funding Account and an alleged misapplication of Joint Venture Cash Calls, valued at $292,094,405.82 and N2,474,295,000 for other purposes. The House Committee called for a full brief “on the account and utilisation of fund with retirement details, cash books, mandates with bank statement and payment vouchers for operation on the NGL funding account.” Members of the committee would want to see the presidential approval memo, “authorising NNPC to disburse the JVCCs amounting to $292,094,405.82 and N2,474,295,000 for other purposes with all relevant documents to support the expenditure.”
