 BY RIMI ALIU DOGO Gide, the bandits’ leader, who controls the Southern part of Zamfara forest, has assured the Niger State Government that students and staff of Government Science College, Kagara, who were abducted on Wednesday, will be released soon. Dogo, who made it clear that the victims were not in his base, promised to connect with other bandit groups to secure their release. He said this when he met with the officials of the Niger State Government through an Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi in Dutsin Magaji, Kotonkoro forest. “The abducted persons, whether they were kidnapped by bandits in Zamfara State or any other neighbouring state, in Kebbi and Kaduna, will be released soon,” he said. He linked the banditry prevalent among the Fulanis to persistent attacks and killings of members of the ethnic group by vigilante groups. He said the bombardments of their camps by the military also worsened matters. He said once it was sure that the Governors were serious about the peace issue, they would accept the peace process initiated by Gumi.
