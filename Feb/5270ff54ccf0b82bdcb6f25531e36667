 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board will prosecute over 200 persons involved in fraud during its examinations, the Registrar of the Board, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, has said. The 200 persons to be prosecuted were part of the 400 candidates caught perpetrating fraud by security agents, he noted, adding that some tertiary institutions were accomplices in the irregularities. The JAMB registrar observed that the Board did not have the resources to prosecute all 400 candidates, as prosecuting one candidate would cost N500,000. Oloyede, who spoke at a media briefing in Abuja, noted that the North accounted for the highest cases of exam malpractices recorded by JAMB in recent times. Twenty Computer-Based Test (CBT) centres were caught while attempting to swap candidates’ pictures and other details, in Kaduna, Zamfara, Gombe, Bauchi, Borno, Sokoto, Kano, and Katsina states. Two persons arrested in Kano for allegedly attempting to change a picture used in last year’s UTME registration at Bayero University, Kano, were paraded at the press briefing in Abuja. “This year, we have over 400 people that were caught whereby those who wrote the exams were different from those who applied. We are waiting for the institutions to come up and report activities of the fraudsters. “The institutions should be vigilant, and we appeal to those young ones that the game is up. There is nothing they do that will not be detected,” the JAMB registrar said.
