 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Lagos State Police Command has arrested a 42-year-old man for allegedly killing his wife at Oke Ira Nla, Ajah area of the state. The man, identified as David Idibie, was said to have caused the death of his wife, Juliana, during an argument in their residence on February 16, 2021, at about 10pm. The deceased was said to have slumped during the argument and sustained a severe head injury, which later led to her death on the same day. The suspect, her husband, was said to have left her in a pool of her blood and refused to save her from dying until she passed on. Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Adejobi Olumuyiwa, who confirmed the incident, said a neighbour of the couple had informed police operatives attached to the Langbasa Division. The operatives, he said, rushed to the scene, arrested the suspect and took the body of the deceased to the mortuary. Condemning the act, the Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, vowed to work with other relevant government agencies and Non-Governmental bodies to tackle domestic violence to a standstill in the state. He also ordered that the matter be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba, for proper investigation. Odumosu admonished couples to always resolve their differences and conflicts with decorum and maturity, noting that the law would not spare anyone who kills his or her spouse. He said this while reiterating his zero tolerance for crimes and criminality, especially domestic violence. The police commissioner commiserated with the family and friends of the deceased on her untimely death and promised to ensure justice in the case.
