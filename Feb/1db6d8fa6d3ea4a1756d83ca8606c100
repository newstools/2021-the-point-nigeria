 ISLAMIC cleric and peace negotiator, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, has said that Boko Haram will soon infiltrate the Fulani killer-herdsmen that have been in constant clashes with farmers across the country and also involved in banditry. Gumi also said the Fulani herders felt their existence was being threatened, so they crossed borders to defend their kinsmen each time they were attacked. The Islamic cleric spoke in an interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today programme on Monday. On the appropriateness of his intervention, Sheikh Gumi said there was a need for a cleric to intervene because the Fulani and those fighting them were two sides that saw each other as enemies, noting that, in actual fact, they are all victims. Gumi claimed that the Fulani bandits were not Boko Haram, but noted, “We have to be very careful. “If the pressure is too much, I am afraid they can be influenced by Boko Haram. We have seen the signs that Boko Haram is going to infiltrate them.” On why he can locate and hold dialogue with the bandits while government authorities cannot find them, Gumi said, “They (government) know. They see them (bandits) by aerial view. “But the military has learned its lesson. The first approach they had, when they go in and start killing, they realised is the wrong way and that they were producing a monster. They are now careful. “The only element I am adding now is ‘look, don’t just wait and watch, go in and negotiate’.”
