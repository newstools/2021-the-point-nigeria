 BY REBECCA AJANI THE Ekiti State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Olawale Fapohunda, has sued the Inspector General of Police over the dismissal of Olajide Omolola, a female corporal who got pregnant without being married. The Police had dismissed the female officer, an indigene of Ekiti State, relying on Section 127 of the Police Act and Regulations, which states that “an unmarried woman police officer who becomes pregnant shall be discharged from the Force, and shall not be re-enlisted except with the approval of the Inspector-General.” Fapohunda is however seeking a court order, declaring this section of the Police Act unconstitutional. Joined, as co-defendants in the suit, referenced, ‘FHC/ AD/ C8/ 8/ 2021’, filed in the Federal High Court, Ado Ekiti, are the Ekiti State Commissioner of Police and the Police Service Commission. The Attorney General prayed the court to determine whether the provisions of Section 127 of the Police Act and Regulations are not in violation of the combined provisions of Sections 37 and 42 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), and Articles 2,3, 5 18(3) and 19 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and therefore unconstitutional, null and void. The suit also seeks an order nullifying Section 127 of Police Act and Regulations as well as an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Inspector General of Police, the Ekiti State Commissioner of Police and the Police Service Commission from implementing the regulation. The dismissal of the female corporal, for getting pregnant without being married, had drawn heated debates in and outside the country, especially in the area of infringement on human rights.
