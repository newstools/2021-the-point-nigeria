 TWO F.B.I. agents were killed and three others injured in a shooting as they were serving a warrant in South Florida on Tuesday morning, the bureau said. The deadly incident occurred just after 6 a.m. as the agents descended on an apartment complex in the city of Sunrise, which is west of Fort Lauderdale, the F.B.I. said. The agents were serving a warrant related to a case involving violent crimes against children. Officials said the man being investigated, whose identity was not released, had apparently barricaded himself inside the complex and was found dead. It was unclear how he died. Two wounded agents were transported to the hospital and were listed in stable condition, the F.B.I. said. There was a heavy police presence in the 4200 block of Nob Hill Road. The police were asking commuters to avoid the area. Local TV stations showed various police agencies assisting in the incident. A spokeswoman for Broward Health referred inquires to the F.B.I. and the Sunrise police. The incident rivals one of the deadliest involving F.B.I. agents in the bureau’s history. In 1986, two agents were killed in Miami and five others wounded in a previous deadly shooting. The gunfire erupted during the pursuit of two violent bank robbers who were also killed in the exchange. – The New York Times
