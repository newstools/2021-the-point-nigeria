 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE African Democratic Congress has congratulated former Finance Minister and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, on her confirmation as the first African and first female to be appointed as the Director-General of the World Trade Organization. The party in a statement, on Monday, signed by the National Chairman, Ralphs Okey Nwosu, said the report of her confirmation, at a time drums of disintegration were sounding louder than ever in Nigeria, came as a relief to those who still believed in a greater Nigeria in the near future. ADC congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari, and indeed all Nigerians, for the success of Okonjo-Iweala’s struggle for the Number One trade facilitating position in the world, saying it was not by chance that Nigerian men and women were directing critical affairs, globally. Nwosu said, “We join President Muhammadu Buhari, and indeed, all Nigerians to rejoice over the successful bid of our own Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in the WTO Director-General race. “We also thank all countries and groups that have made this dream a reality and assure them that the new DG will put her experience to bear in her new duty and demonstrate to the world, once again, that Nigerians, with first rate brains, can excell in the toughest of terrains. “Okonjo-Iweala has demonstrated her capacity to lead in any frontline global position, as a two-time minister in Nigeria, at a time, coordinating all other ministers, and as a force to reckon with at the World Bank, among others. We are sure that she will justify the confidence reposed in her.” The ADC National Chairman, however, urged the President to urgently and truly address the ongoing ethnic crisis in the country, saying hiding behind a finger in the name of intervention could spell doom.
