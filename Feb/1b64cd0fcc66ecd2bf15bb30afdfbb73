 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Samuel Kalu’s goal was not enough as Bordeaux were beaten 2-1 by Metz after conceding an injury time goal in their French Ligue 1 at the Stade Matmut-Atlantique on Saturday afternoon. The Super Eagles winger opened the scoring in the fourteenth minute, assisted by Youssouf Sabaly. Two late goals from Thomas Delaine and Vágner condemned Les Girondins to their 12th loss in the league this season. Kalu’s previous goals in 2020-2021 came against Lens, Dijon and Olympique Lyon. The former Gent star has not been in the Bordeaux squad on eleven occasions this season as a result of injuries. Bordeaux return to action on Wednesday, March 3, hosting the champions Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade Matmut-Atlantique. Barring an injury, Kalu is expected to be called up for international duty next month for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Benin and Lesotho.
