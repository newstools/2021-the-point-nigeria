 TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Osun State Government has directed that one of its schools, lfeoluwa Co-educational Grammar School, Osogbo, be shut indefinitely after some group of students stormed the school to attack a Peace Corps member. The Peace Corps member, a guard at the school, was said to have been hospitalised after sustaining critical injuries from the attack. The students, said to be from St Charles Grammar School, were said to have beaten him black and blue. It was further learnt that a Peace Corps member at St Charles Grammar School, had seized some expensive mobile phones from some students before the trouble started. But for prompt intervention of other security agents, the victim would have been killed in the hands of the aggrieved students. This has, however, led to pandemonium in the school as teachers and students scampered for safety on Thursday. Meanwhile, the state Ministry of Education described the students who carried out the attack as hoodlums and cultists. In a statement issued on Thursday by C. K. Olaniyan, the Coordinating Director of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry said there were efforts to ensure that the hoodlums were arrested and prosecuted. “This is  to inform the general public, especially parents, guardians and students of lfeoluwa  Coeducational Grammar School, Osogbo, that the Honourable Commissioner for Education has directed that the School be closed down temporarily until further notice. “This step is necessary to prevent breakdown of law and order occasioned by the invasion of the School by hoodlums and cultists masquerading as students. “Parents and guardians are advised to keep their wards at home while the closure lasts. The Ministry is working round the clock to ensure that the hoodlums are arrested and prosecuted accordingly,” the statement said.
