 BY ABISOYE JOHNSON THE Ogun State Police Command has arrested a 46-year-old man for stabbing his wife to death over a suspicion that she was engaging in extramarital affairs. The suspect, identified as Sobola Olatunji, a staff of Remo North Local Government Area of the state, was said to have been arrested, following a report by the father of the deceased. The father of the late woman, Ambali Yinusa, had reported at Owode-Egba Divisional Headquarters that his son-in-law stabbed his daughter at the back with a knife during a misunderstanding. The DPO at Owode-Egba Police Division, CSP Matthew Ediae, was said to have dispatched detectives to the scene where the suspect was arrested. The victim was said to have been rushed to the hospital, but died while receiving treatment. Her corpse has been deposited at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital morgue for autopsy, it was learnt. The suspect, Olatunji, claimed to have been married to his wife for 20 years during interrogation, adding that he had suspected that she was having an extramarital affair, owing to some text messages he read on her phone. He added that when he confronted her, the situation degenerated into a fight, which eventually led to the death of the victim. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the immediate transfer of the case to the homicide section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for further investigation and prosecution.
