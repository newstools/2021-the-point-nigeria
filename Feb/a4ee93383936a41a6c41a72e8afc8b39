 BY NGOZI OKORIE A Bayelsa State-based blogger who was arrested and arraigned at the Federal High Court over a defamatory report on the Kogi State Government on his website, on Tuesday, apologised to Governor Yahaya Bello and admitted that the publication was false. The report, published on www.naijalivetv.com, which landed the blogger, Saint Mienpamo Onitsha, in trouble, had alleged that Governor Bello was planning to spend N7bn on the Kogi COVID-19 Isolation Centre, which was destroyed by rainstorm. The blogger’s arrest followed the heated controversy generated by the report, which was published in May 2020, in a bid to clear the air on the embarrassing situation it caused for the Kogi government. In his statement on Tuesday, Onitsha agreed that the publication was false and pleaded with the governor and the state government for pardon. He said, “I hereby render an unreserved apology over a publication, which I posted on my website, www.naijalivetv.com on May 2, 2020, entitled, ‘It will cost us N7 billion naira to build and equip the Kogi Isolation Centre for Covid-19 which rain destroyed, says Yahaya Bello’. “I further express my deepest regret for the post and publication which was false and I regret my action for any embarrassment it may have caused you and your administration. I am sincerely sorry and kindly find a place in your heart to forgive me.”
