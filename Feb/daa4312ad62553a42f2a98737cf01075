 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Osun State Police Command has warned against any form of gathering in the state. Specifically, the Police asked those planning to resume the #EndSARS protest slated for Saturday to desist from carrying out the demonstration. According to a statement issued on Friday by the Police Public Relations Officer, SP Yemisi Opalola, “gathering of any sort now is unlawful and a violation of COVID-19 laws.” The PPRO said, “The intelligence available to the Command revealed that some unscrupulous elements are planning to embark on unlawful gathering, in solidarity with EndSARS protesters elsewhere, to take over the space on Saturday 13th February, 2021, in some parts of the state. “The Commissioner of Police has advised that this unlawful plan should be jettisoned; and consequently warned that, the Command will not condone any act that will jeopardize the peace and tranquility presently enjoyed in the state. Note also that, gathering of any sort now is unlawful and a violation of COVID-19 laws. “The CP appeals therefore, that parents and guardians should warn their children or wards to desist from any act that is capable of causing the breach of peace in the state. “Be warned also that, the Command will not tolerate deliberate blocking of roads to impede free-flow of human and vehicular movements, molestation of innocent members of the public and destruction of any kind. This will be resisted decisively.” “The CP assures good people of the state to go about their lawful business without fear of molestations from any person/group as adequate security measures have been emplaced for maximum security of lives and property of the citizens,” the police said.
