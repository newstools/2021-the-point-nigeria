 BY NGOZI OKORIE IMO State Government, on Friday, confirmed that it invited the Nigerian Military to its domain to flush out members of the Eastern Security Network in Orlu. The statement government insisted that the ESN operatives were hoodlums and would be arraigned for murder. It said the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, was endangering the lives of indigenes with the activities of the ESN in Orlu. The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in the state, Cyprian Akaolisa, disclosed the Government’s position to journalists in Owerri on Friday. “The Imo State Government invited the Military to flush out the hoodlums who call themselves ESN in Orlu,” he confirmed. He said the troops would remain in the troubled areas until absolute peace was restored. The Commissioner alleged that IPOB exploited the #EndSARS protest last year to secure riffles for their operations and commended the Federal Government for deploying troops to address the situation. He said this just as he accused former Governor Rochas Okorocha of playing politics with the crisis in the state. He alleged that while Okorocha went to sympathise with a traditional ruler, Boniface Okereke, who was harassed by a policeman on January 27, he refused to visit the families of the victims allegedly killed by the operatives of ESN. Okorocha’s media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, has however replied, saying that Governor Hope Uzodinma’s administration is confused. “This government is a failed one. Look at what a whole Attorney General of Imo State called journalists to say. This Government can’t succeed in its bid to give Okorocha a personality that is not his own. “Everybody knows Okorocha as a man of peace. This government’s only interest is looting the commonwealth of the state,” he claimed.
