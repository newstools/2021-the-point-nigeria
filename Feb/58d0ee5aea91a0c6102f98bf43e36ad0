 BY ABISOYE JOHNSON YORUBA activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho, on Monday, arrived in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Igboho had promised to visit Ogun State in a video released last Thursday, following viral videos showing soldiers assaulting residents of some villages in the state, as they allegedly escorted herdsmen into the communities. But it was not clear as of the time of filing this report if he was in the state to chase out alleged criminals amongst herdsmen, or for a dialogue with the state government, especially after Governor Dapo Abiodun’s invitation. Abiodun had said he did not invite Igboho to chase out any ethnic group from the state but to nip any form of uprising in the bud. A statement signed by his spokesperson, Remi Hazzan, said,“We as a government did not invite Sunday Igboho to tackle security issues in the state, Igboho made it clear to all media outlets that he would be visiting Ogun State and our decision to offer him consultation is to nip any form of crisis in the bud. “Nobody is welcomed for confrontation in Ogun State.” Details later…
