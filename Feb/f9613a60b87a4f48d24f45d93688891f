 BY NGOZI OKORIE THE Imo State Government has said it has recovered 41 vehicles allegedly stolen from the Imo Transport Company (ITC) by the company’s former Chairman and other officials in past administrations. The state government said more vehicles would be recovered in line with the mandate given to the ITC management committee by Governor Hope Uzodimma, to recover both movable and immovable properties of the company. The Chairman of the management committee of ITC, Ibezim Onyekachi, who said this while speaking to journalists, noted that the vehicles were recovered from Mass Transport Network (MTN) Company, Imo Travels and Tours, and some other transport companies reportedly owned by the former chairman of ITC and those that had been in charge of the company’s affairs in the past. Onyekachi said, “We have recovered about 41 vehicles and still counting, from people who are with ITC properties. It is a fact that the former chairman here converted a lot of ITC vehicles to establish his own private transport company. “Before he became Chairman of ITC, he never owned a transport company. But, immediately he became ITC chairman, he became a transporter.” He alleged that when the former Chairman was leaving the company, a lot of vehicles belonging to ITC went missing from various loading bays across the nation. “The question is, what happened to all those vehicles? We later traced some of the vehicles to his private transport company,” he claimed. “The state government is already in court to get the individuals involved prosecuted, despite the fact that some Nigerians think that the safest place for criminals to run to and hide from punishment is the court,” he added.
