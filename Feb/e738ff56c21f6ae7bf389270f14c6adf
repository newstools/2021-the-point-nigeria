 BY UMMU ABUBAKAR KWARA State Government has directed the immediate closure of some grant-aided schools in Ilorin, the state capital, pending the resolution of the hijab controversy in the schools. Some of the schools had on Friday allegedly locked out some students in hijab. The affected schools are: C&S College, St. Anthony College, ECWA School, Surulere Baptist Secondary School, Bishop Smith Secondary School, CAC Secondary School, St. Barnabas Secondary School, St. John School, Maraba, St. Williams Secondary School and St. James Secondary School; all in Ilorin. Some Islamic organisations had urged the state government to direct the authorities of the affected schools to allow their female students wear hijab. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development, Mrs Mary Adeosun, who announced the closure of the schools in a statement, said, “The closure order came just as a government committee comprising representatives of the Muslim and Christian communities met in Ilorin to iron out the differences between the two communities. “Further communication will be issued to inform members of the public on the development.” “Government calls for calm and urges parents and religious leaders to avoid actions or comments that may further split the two communities,” the statement said.
