 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE POPULAR comedian, Debo Adebayo, also known as Mr Macaroni, has been arrested by the Police at the Lekki tollgate. He was one of the protesters who gathered at the tollgate on Saturday, despite the Lagos State and Federal Government’s warning, to express their dissatisfaction with the reopening of the Lekki tollgate. Adebayo told Lagosians in a Live Instagram that Lekki was under Military rule. It was however gathered that his phone and those of other protesters were seized by security operatives. “How did you think the reopening of tollgate is the next line of action? If you didn’t do that today, we won’t have a right to be here. It is a disrespect to say that you want to reopen at this tollgate. Are you spitting on the graves of the dead? “Na military regime we dey?  We also have a right to be heard. We have a right to protest peacefully,” Adebayo said. About 23 protesters were reported to have been arrested on Saturday. The Federal Government had put security agents on the alert to forestall a fresh protest, tagged, #OccupyLekkiTollgate, planned to hold from Saturday at the Lekki Tollgate, in Lagos. The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, warned Nigerians not to participate in any such protest, arguing that it was being sponsored from outside the country. He said though there was nothing wrong with peaceful protests, such protests were allowed in certain areas, and not at the tollgate. The minister warned that the Federal Government would resist the latest plan, noting that the attack, looting and razing of 269 private and public property would not be allowed to happen again.
