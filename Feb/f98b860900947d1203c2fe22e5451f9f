 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick has hailed the decision of Jamal Musiala to commit his international future to Germany instead of Nigeria. The Bayern Munich attacking midfielder had been at the centre of an international tug of war between Germany, England and Nigeria after breaking into the first team of the Bundesliga champions, but opted for the four-time world champions on Wednesday. Flick, who was assistant coach and later sports director for the German Football Association between 2006 and 2017, said it’s a good decision for German football. “Jamal told me that a little earlier, it’s his decision. I think it’s a good decision for German football,” Flick told reporters. “I’ve always said that there are a lot of good young talents in German football. We don’t need to drive ourselves crazy. “There is always a talent coming up. We just have to try to make them develop well.” Flick stated that Musiala won’t have problems adapting to the Germany squad as there are several Bayern Munich players already there that could offer him support. “The big advantage of Musiala: In the national team he has many professionals around him, with whom he also plays together at Bayern and who can support him.” Musiala celebrated his 18th birthday on Friday and Bayern are on the brink of confirming that the Anglo-German-Nigerian starlet has signed his first professional contract with the club.
