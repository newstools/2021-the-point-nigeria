 BY SALIU SALIU SPECIAL Adviser to the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Media, Salihu Tanko-Yakasai, may be preparing for another suspension by his Principal, following his comment, on Friday, that the All Progressives Congress administration at all levels has failed Nigerians in the area of protecting lives and property. Tanko-Yakassai’s comment came moments after the news of another abduction involving a yet-to-be-determined number of female students of Government Secondary School, in Jangebe, Zamfara State, broke. In a post on his verified Twitter handle, Ganduje’s spokesperson described the insecurity situation under the APC government as a shame. He also called on the government to deal with terrorists decisively or resign. “Clearly, we as APC government, at all levels, have failed Nigerians in the number 1 duty we were elected to do which is to secure lives & properties. Not a single day goes by without some sort of insecurity in this land. This is a shame! Deal with terrorists decisively or resign,” he tweeted. Recall that the media aide to the Kano Governor had criticised President Muhammadu Buhari during the #EndSARS protest last October, for failing to address Nigerians. His principal suspended him for unguarded utterances, having accused the President of lacking empathy for Nigerians. Tanko-Yasai was reinstated after two weeks.
