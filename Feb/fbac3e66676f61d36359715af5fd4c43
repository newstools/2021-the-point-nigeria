Authorities at the airport said the arrest was spectacular because it involved the highest number of wraps to be swallowed or ingested by an individual. “This arrest is spectacular in that it is about the highest number of wraps to be swallowed or ingested by an individual. We have also discovered that this is the first case of cocaine moving from here to India,” Kabir Sani Tsakuwa, NDLEA Commander at the Abuja Airport, said. The suspect, a native of Umuaku-Isiochi village in Abia State, was said to have been arrested during the outward clearance of an India-bound Ethiopian Airline ET910 en route Abuja-Addis Ababa-New Delhi. He was said to have been intercepted at the boarding gate during screening and referred for scanning. He excreted 86 wraps of substances (1.527kg), which proved positive for cocaine after drug test. “Onu, a Lagos based dealer in building materials, was allegedly promised N1.5million upon successful delivery to a recipient in New Delhi, India,” Deputy Commander of Narcotics, Jonah Achema, said in a statement.
