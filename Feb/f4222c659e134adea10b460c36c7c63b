 BY REBECCA AJANI FOUNDER of Sotitobire Praising Chapel, Prophet Alfa Babatunde, who was sentenced to life imprisonment over the disappearance of a 13-month-old boy from his church, has appealed the judgement. The prophet, through his Counsel, Adegboyega Awomolo, filed 12 additional grounds of appeal to his earlier five grounds against his conviction. He prayed the appellate court to set aside his conviction as well as discharge and acquit him. Recall that Babatunde and five workers of his church had been jailed over the mysterious disappearance of the 13-month-old boy, identified as Gold Kolawole, from his church. The five workers jailed along with the Prophet are: Omodara Olayinka, Margaret Oyebola, Grace Ogunjobi, Egunjobi Motunrayo and Esther Kayode. They were found guilty of a two-count charge of conspiracy as well as aiding and abetting kidnapping preferred against them. In the 17 grounds of appeal, Prophet Alfa Babatunde said the trial judge acted without jurisdiction, noting that he was convicted for the offence of aiding and abetting kidnapping with the judge knowing that the investigation, arraignment and trial did not follow due process of law. He claimed to have been convicted in violation of his rights under the Nigerian Constitution, and therefore occasioned a miscarriage of justice. Justice Rita Nosakhare Pemu gave the appellant 14 days to file an amendment to the notice of appeal. She said the date of the adjournment would be communicated to parties involved.
