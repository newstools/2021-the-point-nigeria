 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Players of Delta Queens FC have expressed delight over what they termed an improved welfare package with a promise to step up on expected responsibilities as the Nigerian Women Football league resumed again on February 3. The team’s skipper Ihuoma Onuegbu who made this known to reporters ahead of match day 5 encounter in the Nigerian Women Football League, NWFL, appreciated the state Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa for once again displaying why he has severally been recognised as one of the best sports loving Governors in the country. The Delta Queens goalkeeper who commended the Delta State Government and the Chief Tonobok Okowa-led Sports Commission for returning smiles on the faces of the players noted that they have resolved to reciprocate by putting in the best of commitment on and off the pitch for better results. She said with two wins and two losses in four matches, the players are not comfortable with the team’s position in the league, adding however, that with the payment of outstanding salaries, they are now motivated to give their best. “We are now in a very high spirit for greater commitment to give the best as the league returns, on behalf of my fellow team mates. “I appreciate the state Governor Dr Ifeanyi Okowa and of course our daddy Chief Tonobok Okowa, who surprised us with a much-needed Christmas Package and a prompt payment of salary as well as an improved hostel accommodation, I say thank you. “The league is a marathon, we might not be in the best of position now with two wins and two losses in four outings but we will do our best to end the race well and justify the motivation. “We are happy that the commissioner has looked into our welfare positively and has promised prompt payment of our salaries hence forth.”
