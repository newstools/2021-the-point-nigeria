 BY ABISOYE JOHNSON OVER 100 top monarchs in Ogun State, as well as dignitaries across major sectors, will, on February 20, 2021, join the Olofin Adimula of Ado-Odo, Awori Kingdom, Oba Abdul-Lateef Adeniran Akanni, at the Launching and Foundation Laying Ceremony of his Ultra Modern Private Residence.  The event, which will be the first of its kind in the town, will hold at the Ogun State Housing Corporation, Oke-Oyinbo, Ado-Odo, in the state. Recall that the town had been in crisis for almost a decade, with reports of the monarch being molested by certain interests in spite of his laudable vision for the community. His palace was reportedly burnt, which forced him into what could be called exile in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Stakeholders of the town, as well as other monarchs in Ogun, have however rallied round the monarch to restore peace to the once troubled community.  “The idea of a private palace is very commendable, while looking at what to do with the official one. The import of this launching is to tell everyone that Kabiyesi is back and we should move forward,” a frontline indigene of the town, who spoke with THE POINT in confidence, said. “It is a very good thing for the town in terms of the goodwill and development it will bring, considering the calibre of people that have confirmed attendance and intention to support,” he noted.
