BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE ONE of the appointees of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, identified as Freeman Godwin, has threatened to commit suicide over the non-payment of his salaries since he was appointed. Godwin, said to be an indigene of Obudu, said he borrowed the money with which he completed his documentation when he was given the appointment with Ayade’s government. He was seen threatening to kill himself with a rope around his neck in a two minutes, 47 seconds video that has gone viral. The aggrieved aide was one of those appointed in November 2020, it was learnt. He said in the video that his wife gave birth to a baby through a cesarean section and that he had to sell all he had to settle the bill with the hope that he would be paid. He accused the government of using and dumping appointees, saying, “When the time reaches for work, they will use you and dump you. Now they throw you here and there as if you are nobody.” ”I will die for this government. They play me up and down, sending me here and there. I am ready to die now,” he said. Watch the video:
