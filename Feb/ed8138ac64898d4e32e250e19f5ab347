 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Peoples Democratic Party says it has waded into the rift between Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom. The party called for calm, noting that the internal reconciliation mechanism introduced by the hierarchy of the party between the two governors was in place. The two governors, who have been locked in a battle of different positions on the herders/farmers crisis, are members of the PDP. Ortom had attacked Mohammed for claiming that Fulani herdsmen went about with AK-47 rifles for self-defence. He alleged, on Monday, that his counterpart in Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed, was one of those he described as Fulani terrorists terrorising innocent Nigerians. Ortom also raised the alarm that his life was being threatened by the claim of the Bauchi Governor that he was fuelling a bad media campaign against the Fulanis and worsening the herders/farmers crisis in the country. In reaction to this situation, which many saw as negative for the PDP, the party called for calm. “PDP assures that it has waded into the rift between Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, and his Benue State counterpart, Governor Samuel Ortom,” the party tweeted. “The PDP calls for calm as the internal reconciliation mechanism introduced by the hierarchy of the party between the two governors subsists,” it added. The PDP also urged the Federal Government to take urgent steps to address the escalated security challenges in our country.
