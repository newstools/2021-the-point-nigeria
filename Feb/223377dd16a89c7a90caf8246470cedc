 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO SOME youths suspected to be internet fraudsters, popularly known as ‘Yahoo Boys’, have protested their incessant arrest by security agencies. The suspected Yahoo Boys, on Tuesday morning, blocked the Osogbo/Ilesa Expressway in the state. They were said to have stormed the Ilesa West Local Government Secretariat, Ilesa and made bonfire on the road, therefore halting free flow of traffic along the busy road. The bonfire was said to have been made at the entrance of the Ilesa Council Office. The protesters, it was gathered, were protesting their recent arrest by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. They alleged that the EFCC officials stormed the hotel they lodged in at Ilesa over the night and arrested some of their colleagues. The Point learnt that, owing to the road blockage, motorists plying the expressway were stranded. Some of the road users, who knew the terrain, had to turn back to explore other routes. The protest turned violent as some of the irate youths started shooting. Aside from the bonfire they made at Oke-Omiru, some of them also burnt tyres at Isokun roundabout, blocked Ibala road junction and Oke Omiiru but stop.
