 BY RIMI ALIU GOVERNOR Babagana Zulum of Borno State, on Wednesday, visited the State Specialist Hospital and the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, both in Maiduguri, following Tuesday’s heavy attack by Boko Haram fighters. The governor confirmed that 10 residents were killed and about 50 injured in the attack which affected 60 persons, noting that it was as a result of long-distance shots fired by insurgents. The heavy gunshots were reportedly from the outskirts of Maiduguri, but it was learnt that the Rocket Propelled Grenades went as far as Gwange and Adam kolo communities, which are densely populated areas of the city. Governor Zulum, who confirmed the attacks, directed the state Ministry of Health to pick the bills of victims who sustained varying degrees of injuries and were being treated in the hospitals. He said, “Indeed it is a very sad moment for the people and government of Borno State; about 60 persons were affected. Among them, 10 have died. It was as a result of long-distance shots fired by the insurgents. I believe this is a new trend we have to stop. We experienced a similar incident exactly one year ago. “The solution is to deploy an appropriate form of technology, which we will have to work on. I share the pains of all those affected but we are not just visiting hospitals, we do so much behind the scene in our combined responses to the Boko Haram insurgency and we will keep making these and more efforts.” Speaking on military’s successful operation at Marte, which had, a few days ago, been captured by Boko Haram, the Governor said he was not just pleased but also optimistic that the Nigerian military would sustain its upper hand. He hoped the men would work hard to continue their peace-building and stability efforts in order to ensure that the insurgents did not recapture Marte or any part of the state.
