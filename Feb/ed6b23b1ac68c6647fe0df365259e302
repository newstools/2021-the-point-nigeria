 RIMI ALIU HOURS after sources in the Zamfara State Government said the female students of Government Secondary School, Jangebe, had been released, the state government has denied the report. Government officials had confirmed to the media that the students had been released and were waiting in the Emir of Anka’s Palace to be moved to Gusau. The Commissioner for Information and Culture in the state, Suleiman Tunau Anka, however, said on Sunday afternoon, that the students had not been released. “I want to call the attention of good people of Zamfara State, they should disregard any news regarding the release of abducted students of GGSS Jangebe, it’s not true. But Alhamdulillah, the state government, and securities are trying their best,” he tweeted. The schoolgirls were kidnapped on Friday, a day before the Niger State Government secured the release of the students and staff of the Government Science College, Kagara.
