 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE GOVERNOR Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has ordered the immediate reopening of Shasha market, following the restoration of peace in the area. The Governor also hinged his decision on the need for commercial activities to resume in the market in order to save livelihoods. The agreement to reopen the market was reached during a meeting with the two warring groups, held at the Western Hall, Secretariat, Ibadan. Makinde said, “Considering the economic situation and the peculiarities we have with us, I have heard what you said, and we will immediately reopen the Shasha market. They will bring a bulldozer to the market today. “When my brother Governors visited Seriki Shasha’s palace, while we were walking around, I realised that both the people I saw at Seriki’s place and those I met at Baale’s place were not happy because they had been deprived of doing their jobs.” He said even when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak, Oyo State did not shut down its markets. He said this was because he knew and also explained to the leadership of the country that many people were dependent on daily income for survival in Oyo. He stated, “Since peace more or less has returned to the market and the community, we have given the go-ahead that the market should be reopened. “I have also given instructions for some palliative works to be done. I have instructed that solar light be installed in the market. Any time of the day or night, we will see what is going on in the market. The governor however said the Iroko market would remain shut, saying, “From what we heard, the promoters of that market were actually part of the people causing confusion and causing a problem at the Shasha market. “We will take a long-term view of the Iroko market. But in the meantime, it remains shut.”
