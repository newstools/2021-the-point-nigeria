 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA The influence of African music and culture on the life of Nigeria’s football superstar Asisat Oshoala took centre stage in the latest episode of the FIFA PlayOn Podcast. Oshoala told the podcast’s co-hosts, Universal Music Group’s global chart-topping artist Liam Payne and sports broadcaster Jaydee Dyer, about how the love of Afrobeats inspired her to overcome the odds and became trailblazing global icon. Oshoala, now a prolific FC Barcelona Femení striker, admits that it had been “emotional” to revisit tough times from her past while selecting six songs to represent a personal soundtrack to her life so far. “It made me think back to how I left my family and created my own happiness out of nothing,” she says. “These songs kept me going.” Oshoala explains how she had a strict upbringing and was forced to hide her passion for football from her parents before shooting to international prominence as the top goalscorer and player of the tournament at the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup in Canada. She left Nigeria to pursue her dreams in the beautiful game, but then had to overcome further challenges in England before a spell in China revitalised her career and paved the way for her move to Spain. Additionally, Oshoala spoke about her previous collaborations and determination to use her profile to drive social change by empowering women and girls. “Each time I go on the pitch I want to represent the whole of Africa,” Oshoala said. “It’s about how many people you inspire, and I want to leave a legacy.”
