 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE SEYI Jakande, one of sons of the late former Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, on Thursday, said his late father revalidated his membership of the All Progressives Congress before his demise. Seyi, the third son of Jakande, disclosed this during an interview with journalists at their Ilupeju residence, saying the former governor died in his sleep around 11am at his residence on Thursday. He said his late father lived a fulfilled life and left a big vacuum in the society as a result of his kindness, philanthropic lifestyle and service to humanity. “He (Pa Jakande) revalidated his APC membership on Wednesday, and this morning, he had his breakfast and slept. But around 11am, his aide observed that he was no longer breathing. He then called for medical personnel to examine him. The medical personnel later confirmed that he was no more,” he said. A daughter of the late politician, Ganiyat Bola Jakande, who also spoke with journalists, described her father’s death as a great loss. According to her, he will forever be missed for his impact and contributions to the society, especially Lagos State. “My father was a very caring father and at the same time he was a disciplinarian. He was a no nonsense person, and his love for the less privileged people cannot be compared,” she said.
