 THERE was pandemonium in Maiduguri, on Tuesday, as multiple explosions and heavy gunshot sounds took over parts of the Borno State capital. The gunshot sounds were heard more around the Fori General Area, close to the Giwa Military Barracks. The explosions, which have been reportedly linked to the activities of insurgents trying to take over the city, amid counter-attacks by troops, started at about 5.50pm. Recall that the Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, gave the troops 48 hours ultimatum to recapture Marte Local Government Area, currently under the control of Boko Haram. The insurgents have continued to launch attacks even in the face of the intensified efforts of the Nigerian government to reclaim the space and restore normalcy.
