 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit has disclosed how the agency, in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria, reversed a $3 million fraud perpetrated through the use of cryptocurrency. Director and Chief Executive Officer, NFIU, Modibbo Haman Tukur, disclosed this when he appeared before a Joint Senate Committee appraising the ban on cryptocurrency operations. He said this to buttress one of the arguments earlier put forward by the CBN that cryptocurrencies were largely speculative, anonymous and untraceable. “They are increasingly being used for money laundering, terrorism financing and other criminal activities,” the CBN had said. Corroborating this, the NFIU boss told lawmakers, “We reversed more than $3 million fraud back to the country with the CBN. The fraud was carried out through Cryptocurrency.” According to him, the CBN’s ban on cryptocurrency operations is in the best interest of Nigeria. The CBN had said that the use of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria was a direct contravention of the existing law. It said, “It is also important to highlight that there is a critical difference between a Central Bank issued Digital Currency and cryptocurrencies. As the names imply, while Central Banks can issue Digital Currencies, cryptocurrencies are issued by unknown and unregulated entities. “The question that one may need to ask therefore is, why any entity would disguise its transactions if they were legal. “It is on the basis of this opacity that cryptocurrencies have become well-suited for conducting many illegal activities, including money laundering, terrorism financing, purchase of small arms and light weapons, and tax evasion.”
