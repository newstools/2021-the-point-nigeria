 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Super Eagles striker, Moses Simon returned to scoring ways as Nantes ended their awful run of not winning a league game in 2021 after defeating SCO Angers 3-1 on Sunday. During their seven-game winless run, the Canaries got four points from a possible 21, losing to Metz, Monaco and Lille while drawing against Rennes, Montpellier, Lens and Saint-Etienne. Four minutes into the contest, Simon ran almost half the length of the pitch before slotting past goalkeeper Bernardoni, ending a 574-miute goal drought in all competitions in the process. The Nigeria international hadnâ€™t scored in his last nine games in all competitions, since netting in the 24th minute of a 1-1 draw with Dijon on December 13, 2020. Imran Louza added a second for Nantes in the seventh minute, Mangani pulled a goal back from the spot on 33 minutes and Kader Bamba made sure the points were safe when he scored in the 86th minute. In his first season at Nantes on loan from Levante, Simon was involved in an impressive 17 goals (9 goals, 8 assists) but has not hit the heights this term, scoring just three goals in 21 games in all competitions. Next up for Nantes, who are 18th in the Ligue 1, is a home game against Olympique Marseille on February 20.
