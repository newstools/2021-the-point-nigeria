 A former caretaker council chairman in Katsina, Haruna Musa Mota, has been arrested by the police for aiding bandits in the state. The Katsina Police spokesperson, Gambo Isah, confirmed Mota’s arrest, adding that he was arrested for allegedly aiding and abetting bandits operating in the state. He said Mota had already been charged to court. It was learnt that Mota was arraigned before a senior magistrate court on Friday and had been remanded in a Katsina correctional centre pending the time the police would complete investigation. Mota, according to sources, could have been arrested over a leaked audio interview he allegedly had with some bandits regarding last December’s abduction of 344 students of the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara.
