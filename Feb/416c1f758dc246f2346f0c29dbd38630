 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI PROFESSOR Sunday Oge Elom, on Thursday, assumed office as the third substantive Vice-Chancellor of the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Ebonyi State. He was appointed the Vice-Chancellor of the university on Tuesday, 19th January, 2021. He took over from Professor Chinedum Nwajiuba, whose tenure expired on Wednesday, 10th February, 2021. Elom, a Professor of Medical Biochemistry, is bringing on board over three decades of high level academic and administrative experience in the university system. Stakeholders are optimistic that as a seasoned academic and an astute manager of human and material resources, Elom would not only be building and consolidating on the solid foundations laid by the immediate past administration, he would also be leading change in different areas of the system. This, they said, would be towards breaking new grounds and frontiers for the institution, especially in the pursuit of academic excellence. Under his administration, the university community, the host community and other strategic stakeholders and partners expect a responsible and resourceful leadership, where the interest of the university and that of students and staff would be paramount at all times. Speaking after receiving the hand over note, Elom promised to justify the confidence reposed in him, noting that his guiding principle during his tenure would be hinged on Colossian 3:23 which says, “Whatever you do, do it as unto the Lord, not unto man.” He further assured that he would keep the flag flying, adding that the dreams, goals and vision of the university would be maintained, consolidated and expanded. “We will consolidate, build and expand on the achievement of the past administration under Professor Chinedum Nwajiuba. We will keep the flag of the university flying at full mast and the noble dream of making the university a world class institution would not be allowed to die under my watch,” he declared.
