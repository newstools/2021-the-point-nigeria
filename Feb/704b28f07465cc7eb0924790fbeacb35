 BY SALIU SALIU, KANO RENOWNED Kano Islamic scholar, Sheikh AbdulJabar Nasiru Kabara, has accused Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of banning his activities because he did not support his re-election in 2019. He alleged that Ganduje had employed all tactics to get back at him for not standing with him, but could not find an opening until some people attacked his mode of preaching. He said this just as heavily armed operatives of the Department of State Services took over the mosque and house of the preacher to prevent a breakdown of law and order on Thursday. The state government had banned Sheikh Nasir Kabara from preaching in the state, noting that his mode of teachings were too violent and inciting. The Commissioner for Information in the state, Mohammed Garba, had explained that the state government took the decision to avoid creating tension in the state. He said all seminaries run by the Sheikh would be shut down pending investigation by security agencies. Kabara however told journalists that the Kano governor took the decision based on political and not religious reasons, adding that the Governor had taken the wrong decision at the wrong time. He said, “You can see that the action is more political than religious. “The reasons are very obvious. The person who took the decision (the Governor) has said it, times without number, that he never forgives. I fought him during the last election and he promised to retaliate. Only that he is taking the wrong decision at the wrong time. “So this ban is purely political, it has nothing to do with religion or incitement. I have told my followers to prepare their votes ahead of the next election and do the needful. “Alhamdulillah for everything, I am fighting scholars, not Government, but at the end, Government took over on their behalf.”
