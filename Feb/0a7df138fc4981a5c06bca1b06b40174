 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has called on the warring parties involved in the outbreak of violence in Gombe State to exercise maximum restraint in order to avoid escalation. The President, who made the plea in a statement, on Sunday, signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said Nigerians had shed enough blood over issues that could have been peacefully resolved. He appealed to the two parties to sheathe their swords for the sake of peaceful coexistence, noting that Gombe had enjoyed relative religious harmony for decades and should not allow hoodlums destroy the positive record. The President was reacting to the violence in Gombe State, arising from the Billiri chieftaincy tussle. The statement, titled, ‘Billiri chieftaincy tussle: President Buhari condemns violence, calls for maximum restraint to avoid escalation’, said President Buhari expressed “great shock and deep concern” over the incident. He said, “I’m seriously disturbed by the outbreak of violence in Gombe State and call on the parties involved to exercise maximum restraint to avoid escalation. “The easy resort to violence is uncalled for because there are enough avenues to resolve differences amicably without threatening law and order. “In a circle of violence, there are no winners, except losers. Muslims and Christians should avoid the temptation of resorting to violence in order to express their grievances.” “Nigerians have shed enough blood over issues that could have been peacefully resolved. I appeal to the two parties to sheathe their swords for the sake of peaceful coexistence. “Gombe has enjoyed relative religious harmony for decades and you shouldn’t allow hoodlums destroy this positive record,” the President noted.
