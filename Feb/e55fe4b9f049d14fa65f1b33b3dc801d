 BY VICTOR IZEKOR ALL along, and before the State House of Assembly, ovation characterized the 20-page 2013 budget speech of Governor Kashim Shettima as the legislators and all present at the occasion applauded him for a job well done as he read the balance sheet of his administration for the year 2012 and presented the budget estimates for 2013. From rural development, poverty alleviation, agriculture, works and transport, youth employment, water supply, education, health, infrastructure down to other mass oriented programmes, Governor Shettima drew applause from the legislators over his administration’s 80 per cent clean bill of health for 2012 budge performance.
​
Yet, in spite of the goodies and great expectations for the people in the 2013 budget, coupled with the applause that greeted the presentation and the almost concluded assurance that the budget would scale through in the Assembly without much ado, the Governor in the concluding paragraph of the speech, busted into tears. Yet, with dignifying posture, he said, “I pray, like I know you also do, that in 2013 Insha Allah, Borno State will regain peace. Borno will rise again, our people will become empowered, wealth will spread and Borno will become a reference point in the comity of great societies in Nigeria and beyond.” The unanticipated disposition of the governor evoked a dead silence on the floor of the House. This was indeed an anguished and distressful situation for Governor Shettima who got the applause minutes back as he relayed his performance chart for the period under review. No one knew the cause of his pain and what it was that brought forth tears from the very depth of this being, until a year later.
​
In the same month of December 2013 as in the previous December 2012, Governor Shettima was again before the State House of Assembly, presenting the 2014 Budget estimates. This time, he was more in a cheering mood compared to the hitherto downcast disposition in the previous year.
​
Hear him, “Mr. Speaker, Honourable members, my visit to this hallowed chamber today is at variance with my visit at about this time, in 2012, when I presented the 2013 budget which you expeditiously approved. When I was here in 2012, Mr. Speaker, I must confess that I was a very distressed Governor who only held on to the stubborn strength of hope. “Perhaps, that was the reason for my emotional disposition. I was full of aspirations and wishes, yet my spirit was very low. Though I persistently believed it was coming to pass, I wondered how and when insurgents would move out of our communities and let us be; while I was here in 2012, I wondered when Maiduguri, the capital, the worst affected and the heart of our dear state, would overcome the security challenges that was very well within and around us; I was a critically traumatized governor when I came here in 2012. I was very unhappy even though I was full of hope and anticipation for the future of Borno State. “Mr. Speaker, Honourable members, unlike 2012, when I solely relied on hope, today, I have inside me what is far beyond hope, I have a guarantee, a firm assurance created for all of us, by a brave, patriotic, confident, committed and tough youth population who have defied fears and threats and rose up in defence of our land. “I am not yet a happy Governor because of pockets of challenges we are still battling with, but unlike when I was here in 2012, when Borno’s future seemed more uncertain, today, we have collectively as a people, by one form of contribution or the other, reclaimed our land and we are on the very sure way of making the entire Borno, peaceful and great again.” Kashim was making reference to the crusading Borno Youths who took everyone by storm and surprise in Maiduguri coming out from nowhere to meet the lion in its own den.
​It all started in Hausari area of Maiduguri where with increased pressure from security operatives and merciless attacks by Boko Haram, the youths mobilized themselves and decided to thenceforth apprehend any insurgent who crossed the area en route the Monday Market or Babban Layi for robberies or the usual bombing or shooting runs.
​
Baba Lawan Jafar, who later became the pioneer Chairman of Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) in Borno State, was the first youth who, in May 2013, fearlessly chased a gunman with a stick, successfully capturing him and handing him over to soldiers. Afterwards, Jafar’s friend, one Modu Milo, impressed by the heroic act of his friend, decided to join in the hunt. The new group was seen as heroes by some and pejoratively perceived as “alarm blowers” by others, thus many distanced themselves to avoid the wrath of Boko Haram. But two weeks later, Jafar and Milo were still alive, hale and hearty. So within a short time, dozens of youths joined them and the population continued to swell.
​The youths who metamorphosed into Volunteer Youths Group (VYG) resolved to dare the lion in its den as insurgency was taking so much toll on the social, economic and political life of the people and things were going haywire and unbearable. “Everywhere you go, the Borno man or woman is being stigmatized”. According to the Chairman of the Volunteer Youths Group, Abubakar Malum, despite apparent danger inherent in their action, there was no going back as the die was now cast for the reign of terror to go. “We were moved to take the decision because the youths in Maiduguri are facing extinction. Parents, sisters and brothers have died either in the hands of the insurgents or angry soldiers – enough is enough. It is now fight to finish and the offenders must be bought to book. The coming into the volatile scene of the VYG was indeed a watershed. Its entry broke the myth that the Boko Haram insurgents were not assailable as the youths demystified the government changed the name of the Volunteer Youths Group to Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) insurgents and proved themselves capable of giving Boko Haram a good fight. It showed abundantly that when a man is driven to the wall, he will fight back with whatever he could lay his hands upon notwithstanding the strong fist of his adversary. It brought hope to the people that were already being dismayed or helpless at the perceived inability of the security agencies, especially the army, to give the insurgents a good fight. Cashing in on the public acceptance of the Vanguard Group and its impacts in the fight against the insurgency, Governor Shettima’s administration moved in the speed of a meteor to streamline the functions of the body and give incentives to its members. The government initiated through the military, some basic training for the boys, designating the group Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) as Vigilante Group assisting the security agencies. While in training, members are each paid N10,000 and after the training, they are given a monthly stipend of N20,000 each. The state government planned to train under is first phase scheme, 20,000 members. The trained members of the CJTF are expected to be the first port of call for the state quota with regard to future recruitment in the security agencies, especially the Army. And this proved to be so later, as the Senate during Kashim’s governorship directed the Federal Government to recruit more soldiers as a result of the insurgency. The Upper Chamber of the National Assembly specifically directed that in the exercise as it affected the North-east, premium or consideration should be given to members of the Civilian JTF. Happily enough, the implementation of this directive from the Senate is being implemented. The action of the youths, which is well acclaimed by many, has yielded results more so with the support of the security agencies in the state. The youth revolution against the onslaught of the insurgency in Maiduguri was a watershed. It is observed that since the revolt of the youths against the injustice of Boko Haram the members of the sect had since abandoned the towns and cities into the bush and had made the bush their habitat from where they come out to launch attacks and escape back to the same. CJTF has come to stay as one of the effective ways to check crime and rebellion. It has become partner in the war against the insurgency. As the Governor of Borno, Kashim Shettima described the members as “Our Heroes and Dependable Ally”. Similarly, as the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tukur Buratai commended the efforts of the members of the CJTF, describing them as good scouts. It would be recalled that during the attack on Giwa Military barracks, its members came out in hundreds jointly with the soldiers to defend the barracks. Besides, they remained invaluable assistance in military operations against the insurgents as the (CJTF) are locals who live with the people and understand the terrain.
​
CJTF has come to stay and remains one of the enduring legacies of Kashim Shettima’s administration. No doubt, the CJTF like any other outfit has its shortcomings but the merits outstretch the demerits.
​
I am compelled to go all the length to show the immense contribution of Borno Youths in the war against insurgency and relate the same to the contribution of the elite and politicians in the on-going terror war, especially in this part of the country. This has become imperative following the recent change of the Service Chiefs and the great expectation of magic to happen. Such magic might be an illusion if other stakeholders in the nation’s project of eliminating the insurgency and other security challenges refuse to be part of the project.
​
In particular, as far as insurgency is concerned, its epicentre is Borno State and the state has experienced deaths, sorrow and blood in unprecedented magnitude and the lion’s share still undergoing the torture and man-inhumanity to man. It’s the most traumatised and bearer of the burden, consequently Borno must be seen in the leadership position in the elimination of this scourge. The youths of Borno have played their part and are still doing so. Some have paid supremely in this wise.
​
The inevitable questions that provoke, prick and prod the minds of many are how far have the elders, elite and politicians in this part of the country responded to the elimination war of terror, more so with the belief erroneously or otherwise that the concerned group has not lived up to expectation? Can the war against terrorism or insurgency succeed without the contribution or support of this group, especially when the allegation of sabotage, true or false, is hanging on their necks of its members?
​
It would be recalled that the military had on some occasions indicted the civil populace especially the elite and politicians in this part of the country of collaboration with the insurgents and terrorists to frustrate the war on insurgency. The one time Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Kenneth Minimah, during his pulling out of the Army parade in Abuja, said it was regrettable that instead of cooperating with the military to fight the insurgency, some notable Nigerians were introducing politics and religion into the whole show. Besides, there have been statements by the Nigerian Army of deliberate moves by some individuals and political groups to ensure the failure of war on terror for their self-centeredness and ambition. One of such press statements issued in September 2015, in Abuja by the Acting Director of Army Public Relation, Colonel Sani Kukasheka reads in parts, “The Nigerian Army wishes to inform the public and send a very strong and serious final warning to some prominent individuals and political groups who hailed from Borno State in particular and North East generally, that there is information of plans by some highly placed individuals and political groups to undermine and scuttle the fight against terrorism and insurgency in this country.
​
“The unscrupulous individuals and their cohorts were determined to reverse the gains made and scuttle our efforts of achieving the President directive to defeat Boko Haram terrorists within three months. They are enlisting the services of some Non-Governmental Organization in this grand design.
​
“It has come to our knowledge that they were employing every means to see that our operation does not succeed in order for them to continue to enjoy certain benefits. It has been revealed that they are employing the services of marabouts and other unethical means in order to frustrate our efforts and the operations in addition to campaign of calumny. “We are aware of their clandestine meetings and other diabolical efforts to achieve their nefarious aims. This would not be tolerated. Therefore, such individuals and groups should be warned in unmistakable terms that anyone found would be dealt with accordingly.
​
“People should place the interest of the nation above any personal gain or ambition. The continued loss of lives and properties in this country through terrorists activities does no one any good,” It would be recalled recently that the erstwhile Army Chief of Staff, Lt General Tukur Buratai stated that terrorism banditry, insurgency, kidnapping and other security challenges bedeviling the nation would end when the citizens want them to end. General Buratai who spoke in Abuja to state House reporters after briefing President Muhammadu Buhari on the security situation in the country pointed out that Nigerians could end the spate of insecurity in the country by exposing the criminals living within them. Buratai stated that Nigerians were not helping matters by only complaining about insecurity and laying the blame at the door steps of the security agencies.
​
Similarly, while speaking at the Shehu of Borno palace in Maiduguri recently while on condolence visit to the State Government and people of Borno following the mass killing of passengers and destruction of property at Auno village by the insurgents, President Buhari wondered how the terrorists would travel all the way from the Lake Chad region of the state to Maiduguri and environs committing havoc without the possible knowledge of the people.
​
Even Kashim Shettima as the Governor of Borno State, indicted some Borno prominent citizens of paying lip service to ending the insurgency. While indicting some of deliberately inciting disaffection against his administration through intrigues, he never spared others who shut their eyes against the reconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement programme of his administration. At a point, he threatened he would expose the saboteurs. In his worlds, “I know the consequences of exposing the masquerade, but I would do it if they persist.” He made reference to a particular Borno politician who could not afford Fifty Thousand Naira (50,000) in aid of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Borno State, but could afford billions of naira as donation to a political party. He however commended Alhaji Mohammed Indimi, a prominent Borno Businessman, who has contributed immensely to the rehabilitation and resettlement programme of the government.
​
However, with regard to the military’s indictment or allegation of some Borno elite and politicians trying to sabotage the efforts of the army in the on-going war against insurgency, Ambassador Gaji Galtiman, (now of blessed memory), the Chairman of Borno elders forum, challenged the military to expose the names of those concerned.
​
At this crucial stage of the war against insurgency, all stakeholders must bury their hatchets, individual or group interest must give way to concerted voice and collective action to subdue once and for all these security challenges that are daily becoming baffling and cancerous. The approach to ending the war is multi-dimensial, but there must be a point of convergence and this centres on the collective agreement in the interest of the society.
​
The youths of Borno have contributed their quota to the elimination of the ongoing terror war. The elders, politicians and elite must not only support or make their own contribution one way or the other, they must also be seen to do so.
