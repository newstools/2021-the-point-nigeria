 BY BANYO TEMITAYO SOCIO-ECONOMIC Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has asked the World Bank to release details of the transparency and accountability mechanisms under the agreement for the release of approved funds to improve access to electricity in Nigeria between 1999 and 2020. SERAP also seeks to know whether there is any provision that would allow Nigerians and the civil society to monitor the spending of the recently approved $500m by the government, its agencies, and electricity distribution companies. The request followed the approval by the World Bank Board of Directors, last week, of $500 million to help boost access to electricity in Nigeria and improve the performance of the electricity distribution companies. SERAP, in an application to World Bank President, David Malpass, dated February 6, 2021, and signed by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, urged the Bank to explain the rationale for the approval of $500m to implement electricity projects in the country, despite reports of widespread and systemic corruption in the sector. The organisation also mentioned the failure of the authorities to enforce a court judgment ordering the release of details of payments to allegedly corrupt electricity contractors who failed to execute any projects. It said, “This application is brought pursuant to the World Bank’s Access to Information Policy, which aims to maximize access to information and promote the public good. There is a public interest in Nigerians knowing about the Bank’s supervisory role and specifically its involvement in the implementation of electricity projects, which it has so far funded. “The $500m is part of the over $1billion available to Nigeria under the project titled: Nigeria Distribution Sector Recovery Program. “We would be grateful for details of any transparency and accountability mechanisms under the agreement for the release of funds, including whether there is any provision that would allow Nigerians and civil society to monitor the spending of the money by the government, its agencies, and electricity distribution companies.” SERAP added, “Should the Bank fail and/or refuse to release the information and documents as requested, SERAP would file an appeal to the Secretariat of the Bank’s Access to Information Committee to challenge any such decision, and if it becomes necessary, to the Access to Information Appeals Board. “SERAP may also consider other legal options outside the Bank’s Access to Information framework.” It said releasing the information and documents would enable Nigerians and the civil society to meaningfully engage in the implementation of electricity projects funded by the Bank, contribute to the greater public good, and enhance the Bank’s oft-stated commitment to transparency and accountability. It stated, “The World Bank has been and continues to be involved in overseeing the transfer, disbursement, spending of funds on electricity projects in Nigeria. The Bank also reportedly approved a $750 million loan for Nigeria’s electricity sector in June 2020 to cut tariff shortfalls, protect the poor from price adjustments, and increase power supply to the grid. As such, the World Bank is not a neutral party in this matter. “SERAP is seriously concerned that the funds approved by the Bank are vulnerable to corruption and mismanagement. The World Bank has a responsibility to ensure that the Nigerian authorities and their agencies are transparent and accountable to Nigerians in how they spend the approved funds for electricity projects in the country, and to reduce vulnerability to corruption and mismanagement. “SERAP also believes that the release of the requested information and documents is of paramount importance to the public interest in preserving the legitimacy, credibility and relevance of the Bank as a leading international development institution. The Bank ought to lead by example in issues such as transparency and public disclosure raised in this request. “It would also demonstrate that the Bank is willing to put people first in the implementation of its development and governance policies and mandates, as well as remove any suspicion of the Bank’s complicity in the alleged mismanagement of electricity projects-related funds. “SERAP’s report, titled: From darkness to darkness: How Nigerians are paying the price for corruption in the electricity sector documents widespread and systemic corruption in the electricity sector, and reveals how about N11 trillion electricity fund was squandered by successive administrations in Nigeria since the return of democracy in 1999.”
