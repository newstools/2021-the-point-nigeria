 THE Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, dismissed a suit seeking an order compelling the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to investigate former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, for alleged misappropriation of N900 billion. Justice Okon Abang, in a judgment, dismissed the suit for lacking in merit. A group, Patriots for the Advancement of Peace and Social Development (PAPS), had approached the court in an exparte application. The PAPS, through its Chairman, Dr Sani Shinkafi, had prayed the court to order the EFCC to act on the 15 petitions seeking urgent action by the anti-graft agency. Justice Abang, who dismissed the application for lacking in merit, also held that the application was filed out of time. The judge said, in line with Order 34 Rule Four of the Federal High Court Rules, applications such as the one by the applicant should be done within three months of receiving the reports and documents on which the plaintiff based his case. Justice Abang maintained that in line with the rules, the court lacked the jurisdiction to extend the time for hearing such a matter as it was statute barred. â€“ NAN
