The picketing was done against the background of alleged refusal of the Registrar General of the commission to approve staff promotion and contract inflation, among others. President, NLC, Ayuba Waba, led other executives and members of the agencies’ unions to the CAC office, to stage the protest, which began as early as 8am. Workers and visitors could not access the office, as the entrance was blocked by the protesting workers. The NLC President, who spoke during the protest, accused the RG, Garba Abubakar, of sitting on staff promotion and approving questionable contracts. He alleged that Abubakar engaged environmental experts to fumigate the Commission’s office for N35million, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and also contracted another person to paint the Zone 5 Annexe office for N25million. The registrar-general was also accused of transferring married female staff members out of the Commission. Workers and visitors were still stranded outside the premises of the CAC as of the time of filing this report. Details later…
