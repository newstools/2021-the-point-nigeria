 AYO ESAN FOUNDER of One Love Family, Satguru Maharaj ji, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari not to politicise the issue of COVID-19 vaccines by allowing Nigerian scientists to develop the African type of vaccines good for the warm weather. Maharaj ji, who disclosed this at a press conference in Lagos, also urged the government to fortify the checking of travellers coming into the country, noting that the relaxation of checks meant huge danger for the country. He also called on the Federal Government not to sit on grants from foreign donors  meant for Nigerian workers to help alleviate their suffering in the midst of the economic recession and the Coronavirus lockdown. “Believe me, the release of these grants would give President Buhari a boost in history and will greatly counter the bad publicity going on about his administration,” Maharaj ji said. He also urged the President to issue another Executive Order to stop the police from taking or receiving money on the roads, saying “so long as they are doing it, it will affect the Fortune of APC in future elections.” He asked President Buhari to give the breakdown of foreign loans obtained by his government, just as he also urged him to publish names and photographs of those who had been caught and jailed by the EFCC/ICPC for the people to see. This would help stop future occurrences, he said.
