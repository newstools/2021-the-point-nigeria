 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO NO fewer than 15 students of Osun State School of Nursing and Midwifery, Osogbo, have tested positive for Coronavirus. The Point gathered from sources that a student in the school hostel, last week, tested positive for the virus. The development, it was learnt, compelled the management of the school to mandate a compulsory COVID-19 test for all the students. Some students living with the COVID-19 patient were said to have been isolated. It was gathered that at the weekend, about five students were discharged from the Isolation centre. Some of the students are still expecting their COVID-19 results while some students, said to be 15, tested positive. It was gathered that those who tested positive had been moved to the Isolation centre. When contacted, the Osun State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, confirmed that some students tested positive for COVID-19 in the school. But Isamotu couldn’t disclose the exact figure of those that tested positive. He only said that a few students contracted the virus. “Just like anybody else, a few students tested positive. So, few students tested positive, not many. I can assure you,” he said. The State Government has called on residents of the state, especially those with traits of virus, to go for COVID-19 test as the number of coronavirus cases in the state increases.
