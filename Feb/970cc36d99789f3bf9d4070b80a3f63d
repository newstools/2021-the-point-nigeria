 BY ABISOYE JOHNSON FORMER Governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel, will finally dump the Peoples Democratic Party for the All Progressives Congress today (Tuesday), in Sagamu, Ogun State, findings by our correspondent have revealed.

A close associate of the Governor, who confirmed this in confidence to The Point, said he had no choice at this point than to go to where he was being courted strongly, noting that the PDP, especially in Ogun State, had long been troubled. “He will be formally joining the APC today. Not that I am all confident that it is the right thing to do. But no one should also wait without taking calculated steps when the chips are down in the Nigerian political terrain,” the source said. “If you are not treated like a king in your own house, outsiders will see your worth and give you what you deserve. Which then do you choose? I totally understand the situation and can confirm to you that by today, Otunba Gbenga Daniel would be officially in APC,” he added. It was learnt that Daniel would register as a member of the ruling party at his Isote Ward 12, in Sagamu, after a meeting which is expected to hold at 12 noon.
