 ABDULRASHEED Maina, former boss of defunct Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT), on Friday, told the Federal High Court, Abuja, that his leg might be amputated if not granted bail to have adequate medicare. Maina, through his Counsel, Sani Katu, SAN, told Justice Okon Abang at the resumed trial. Katu said his client was taken to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, because of his worsening health condition and the medical report was exhibited in the bail application. The lawyer, who said that Kuje Correctional Centre where Maina was kept did not have the facility to attend to his state of health, said if not granted bail, his knee might be amputated. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Maina had, on Jan. 20, approached Justice Abang for another bail after his arrest for jumping the first bail. Maina, in a motion on notice, dated and filed on December 24, 2020, brought by one of his lawyer, Anayo Adibe, said the application became necessary over his worsening health condition. In the motion, the ex-pension boss told the court that he had reasonable and responsible sureties who were willing to act as sureties if granted bail. â€“ NAN
