 BY LINUS CHIBHIKE THE Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Idris Wase, has sacked his Legislative Aide over allegations of using his office to defraud Ministries, Departments and Agencies. The Deputy Speaker disclosed this while clarifying that the sacked aide did not resign voluntarily. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker, Umar Mohammed Puma, quoted his Chief of Staff, Aminu Ibrahim Make, to have said that a new Legislative Aide, Musa Suleiman Rabo, had been appointed to replace the sacked aide last December. The statement reads, “The attention of Chief of Staff to the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Malle, has been drawn to a purported resignation of a former legislative aide to the Deputy Speaker by name Ahmed Tijjani Abubakar. “For the avoidance of doubt and to keep the records straight, it is imperative to clarify that the person in question was relieved of his appointment since last year, after he was discovered to be fraudulently using his position in the office to defraud ministries, departments and agencies. “The Deputy Speaker, after receiving the complaints through his Chief of Staff, Hon. Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Malle, was left with no choice than to relieve him of his appointment, and has since replaced him with Musa Suleiman Rabo whose appointment letter was appended and took effect from 8th December, 2020 against Ahmed’s belated letter of resignation, dated 27th January 2021, and was supposed to be approved by the Chief of Staff to the Deputy Speaker. “Therefore, the reported voluntary resignation was a misrepresentation of what actually transpired. I, therefore, appeal to the media to always cross check their facts before going to press for proper and effective information dissemination.”
