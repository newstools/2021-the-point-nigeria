 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE FORMER Vice President Atiku Abubakar has reacted to the Central Bank of Nigeria’s clampdown on cryptocurrency operations, saying this is a wrong time to to introduce policies that will restrict the inflow of capital into Nigeria. He argued that the Federal Government could regulate the sub-sector to prevent any abuse that might be inimical to national security, noting that this would be a better option than an outright shutdown. He made his position known in a statement titled, “We Need To Open Up Our Economy, Not Close It” on Saturday. Atiku, who was the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 election, noted that the major challenge facing Nigeria was youth unemployment, which he said was compounding the problem of insecurity in the country. He said there was already immense economic pressure on the youths, which Government must reduce “rather than add to it.” The former VP said, “The number one challenge facing Nigeria is youth unemployment. In fact, it is not a challenge, it is an emergency. It affects our economy, and is exacerbating insecurity in the nation. “What Nigeria needs now, perhaps more than ever, are jobs and an opening up of our economy, especially after today’s report by the National Bureau of Statistics indicated that foreign capital inflow into Nigeria is at a four year low, having plummeted from $23.9 billion in 2019, to just $9.68 billion in 2020.” He added, “Already, the nation suffered severe economic losses from the border closure, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. “This is definitely the wrong time to introduce policies that will restrict the inflow of capital into Nigeria, and I urge that the policy to prohibit the dealing and transaction of cryptocurrencies be revisited.” He said Nigeria must create jobs and expand the economy. “We must remove every impediment towards investments. We owe the Nigerian people that much,” he noted.
