 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE IMMEDIATE past Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, on Thursday, said winning the war against insurgents and solving the insecurity problem of the country would require a multi-pronged approach. The Military angle to the solution was just an aspect, he noted, just as he pointed out that it might take Nigeria another 20 years to address the daunting challenges. Buratai spoke when he appeared for screening, as an Ambassadorial nominee, before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, led by Senator Adamu Muhammad Bulkachuwa. He explained that, currently, the Army had low intelligence capacity, compared to the magnitude of problem at hand, but noted that the Military had however won the affected communities back. “The military alone cannot solve this. There should be hospitals, schools, roads and government presence in these communities. There are so many ungovernable spaces and until these spaces have government presence, it (insecurity) will not be resolved,” he stated. The former Service chiefs arrived at the National Assembly complex for screening, on Thursday, at about 11.30am. Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare, led the former chiefs to the hearing room. Recall that a heated controversy had trailed the appointment of the retired service chiefs as ambassadors, following what some people described as worsened insecurity under their watch. Many groups had called on the Senate and well meaning Nigerians to reject their nomination. The former Service Chiefs who appeared for screening include: retired Chief of  Defence Staff, Abayomi Olonisakin, ex-Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai; former Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok-Ete Ekwe Ibas; and former Chief of Air Staff, Sadique Abubakar.
