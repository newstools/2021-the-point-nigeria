 LINUS CHIBUIKE IMMEDIATE past Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Abdullahi Dikko, is dead. Dikko, who was CG of Customs between 2009 and 2015, was said to have died after a protracted illness at the age of 60. A Federal High Court in Abuja had in February last year, issued a bench warrant for the arrest of the late Dikko over failure to appear in court to answer to a charge of fraud brought against him and two others by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC). His lawyer had then claimed that Dikko was on admission in a London hospital, which stalled the case. Dikko, Makarfi and Hussaini were, among others, accused of inducing the Managing Director of Cambial Limited, Yemi Obadeyi, to pay N1.1 billion (N1,100, 952,380.96) into the account of Capital Law Office as a refundable “completion security deposit” for the purchase of 120 units of duplexes as residential accommodation for officers of the Nigeria Customs Service. Hussaini was said to have distributed the money into various other bank accounts and for his part in the deal, he was rewarded with the sum of $3 million. No official statement had been released on his demise as of the time of filing this report. Details later…
