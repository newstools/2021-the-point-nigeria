 Super Eagles duo, Joe Aribo and Leon Balogun were in action for Rangers Football club who got a 4-3 away win against Antwerp in Thursday’s UEFA Europa League (EL). Aribo netted Rangers opener in the 38th minute later he received a brilliant pass from Alfredo Morelos to send a long-range shot past the helpless Antwerp goalkeeper. His compatriot, Balogun came in as substitute for injured James Tavernier in the 26th minute and marshalled the defence. Speaking at the post-match press conference, manager Steven Gerrard explained how his lads showed amazing character. “I am very pleased with the outcome of the game in-terms of the result. “I think the boys showed amazing character to keep going and keep fighting for the right result. “It was a crazy match and I am sure the neutrals enjoyed it, but as a coach or a manager, I will be looking into it as we had too many issues defensively. “The goals we conceded are poor from our point of view, so there is certainly work to do and a lot of improvement to do, especially at this level where you get punished a lot more. “But, in-terms of what the players are giving me, I asked them for more at half-time as I felt we are only committed to the game, I wouldn’t say half-heartedly, but we weren’t ourselves. “We were a little bit slow and a little bit lethargic at times, and we have conceded goals that we don’t normally concede. “So I asked the players for more both in and out of possession – I told them to play with more belief and more personality when we were regaining the ball as we were getting some fantastic opportunities, but we weren’t really taking them in the first half. “But in the second half, we played with much more character and belief so the outcome of the game is fantastic for us, but there is still a lot of improving to do.”
