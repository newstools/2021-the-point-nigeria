 BY AYO ESAN THE Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers has resolved to prevail on Governor Kayode Fayemi to contest for Presidency in 2023, stressing that he is well qualified for the task of leading the nation. Towards this, the Obas said they would send a delegation at an opportuned time to prevail on him to contest for the position. The monarchs took the decision at their statutory monthly meeting in Ado Ekiti on  Tuesday, 23rd February 2021, after listening to a four-man voluntary organisation,  known as “Our Belief Project”, led by Hon Aloba Abejide. Abejide had pleaded with the traditional rulers to call on the Governor to make up his mind early and declare his intention to contest in the 2023 Presidential election. The state Chairman of the Traditional Rulers Council, who is the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, HRM Oba Adebanji Ajibade Alabi Afuntade 1, who welcomed the team to the Obas Council Chambers, in tandem with complimentary remarks from several traditional rulers, spoke at length on the sterling qualities of Governor Fayemi. He stressed that the challenges confronting Nigeria today would definitely need a young, dynamic, energetic and brilliant  Fayemi who had the wherewithal to be a good president. Oba Alabi noted that Governor Fayemi was one of those who fought the military to bring back democracy to Nigeria and that a man of his calibre, with a higher degree in war studies would know how to resolve the issue of insecurity in Nigeria. Summarising the views of his fellow Obas, the foremost traditional ruler said this was the time for an Ekiti indigene to become the President of Nigeria, adding that Ekiti people had helped many other tribes in the past to get to the top. “All Ekiti Obas will support Fayemi wholeheartedly in the 2023 Presidential election,” the Alawe stated. Oba Alabi recalled the memorable and positive remarks made by the Sultan of Sokoto and Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, during the October 2020 Arewa Summit in Kaduna. He said they expressed implicit confidence in Governor Fayemi. While saying Fayemi would be the right candidate for the 2023 Presidency, the traditional rulers, however, advised politicians in Ekiti to be united and work together on the project. The team that earlier pleaded with the Obas included Aloba Abejide, Akin Aregbe, Mrs. Mojisola Fafure and Adio Folayan.
