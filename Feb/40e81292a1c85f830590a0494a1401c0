 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI A woman, native of Okpoduma Kperete, Ezza Effium, in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, has given birth to a set of twins inside the bush while fleeing the crisis zone in Effium community. The woman, identified as Mrs. Ovu Favour, has however not been able to trace her husband, Ovu Raphael and her three other children, owing to the displacements caused by the crisis. Speaking during a press visit, the Chairman, Ebonyi State Family Law Center, Mrs Elizabeth Nwali, represented by the Secretary, Mrs Edith Okpani, disclosed that the woman and her twin baby boys, delivered in the bush, were brought to the center by a good Ebonyian. She said because the matter was beyond the jurisdiction of the resolution center, it was transferred to the state Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development for adequate medical attention. Speaking with The Pointâ€™s correspondent in Abakaliki, the Permanent Secretary, Ebonyi State Ministry of Women Affairs, Mrs  Florence Nwali, confirmed the report, saying the ministry had given adequate medical care to the young mother and her new babies. She added that they would be discharged today (Wednesday) from the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki. The Point gathered that the young mother was still separated from her husbands and children, owing to the crisis between Ezza and Effium communities, which had continued despite government efforts. Meanwhile, during a visit to the newborn session of the hospital, our correspondent was denied access to the woman and her children.
