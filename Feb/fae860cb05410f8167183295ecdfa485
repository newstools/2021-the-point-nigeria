 BY RIMI ALIU ISLAMIC scholar, Sheikh Ahmed Gumi, has urged the Federal Government to give ‘blanket amnesty’ to bandits terrorising Nigeria. He called for the same kind of amnesty given to Niger Delta militants at the time, saying he met with the bandits with a view to fostering absolute peace in Niger State. Gumi spoke to journalists after meeting with the bandits and their leaders, as well as Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello of Niger State. He said his meeting with the bandits was fruitful, adding that the different factions had their complaints which they expected to be addressed. “The outcome is very positive because we have warring factions. Each faction is saying they have their own complaints and greviances which are very simple. There is hope that we can resolve this,” Gumi said. “I appeal to government and recommend that government should do to them exactly what they did to the Niger Delta militants and give them a blanket amnesty. Then if anybody continues, we will deal with him,” he added.
