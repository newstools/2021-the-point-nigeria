 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE WITH AGENCY REPORT EUROPOL, the EUâ€™s law enforcement agency, has issued a warning that criminals are selling fake negative COVID-19 test certificates. There are also fake test certificates from clinics in Nigeria sold in forums used by organised crime groups, according to BBC News. This was as BBC reported that its investigation found falsified NHS certificates for sale online. The fear is that this could enable people to cheat travel restrictions, it said. Chairman, Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, had lamented that many Nigerians seeking to travel out of the country were presenting fake COVID-19 test results. Mustapha, who spoke at a briefing of the Task Force, early January, said this just as he noted that the level of doubts about the existence of the virus was alarming among Nigerians. He said it had become embarrassing to note that some Nigerians continued to present fake COVID-19 results when travelling outside the country, adding that this remained a major source of concern to the Federal Government. To address the situation and eliminate fraud, the SGF said the Federal Government had directed private laboratories to put in place measures that would validate COVID-19 results. According to him, all passengers are also to be registered on the travel portal before test samples are processed.
