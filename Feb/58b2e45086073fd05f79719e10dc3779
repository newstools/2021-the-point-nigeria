 BY NGOZI OKORIE An 18-year-old first-year student of the Federal University of Technology Owerri, has reportedly committed suicide. The fresh undergraduate, identified as Daniel Uchenna Nwafor, was said to have hung himself to death in his room at the school, on Tuesday, owing to yet-to-be identified reasons. Sources said the deceased, who was in the Department of Chemistry, had complained to some friends about some challenges he had when he returned to school but they did not think they were deep enough to warrant him taking his own life. “Some of his friends said he left a note for his mother before committing suicide but the Police have started their investigation,” a source said. Public Relations Officer, FUTO, Uche Nwaelue, confirmed the incident, noting that it was worrisome that an 18-year-old boy would take his own life. “Somebody brought the picture to me though I have not visited the scene. I wonder why an 18-year-old person would take his life; this is end time,” the PRO said. Police Public Relations Officer in Imo State, Orlando Ikekwo, also confirmed the incident, noting that the deceased’s body had been taken to the mortuary.
