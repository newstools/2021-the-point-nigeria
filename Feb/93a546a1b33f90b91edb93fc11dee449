 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Faustino Anjorin’s name stands out as the only Nigeria-eligible player included in Chelsea’s updated UEFA Champions League (UCL) squad for the knockout rounds of the competition. New Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has retained the England youth international in the squad list. Anjorin features on the Blues List B due to his age in addition to being on the books of the club for more than a decade. The 19-year-old’s first-ever squad involvement for a Champions League clash was against Russian side Krasnodar on December 8 and he went on to make his full debut for his boyhood club, playing for eighty minutes. Two teenagers of Nigerian descent, goalkeeper Prince Adegoke and fullback Derrick Abu, qualify to be included on Chelsea’s List B but have been omitted from the updated list. There is no place for Norwegian-Nigerian striker Bryan Fiabema due to the fact that he joined Chelsea thirteen months ago. Chelsea will take on Atlético Madrid in the round of sixteen first leg at the Estadio Metropolitano Madrid on February 23 and the second leg will hold at Stamford Bridge on March 17.
