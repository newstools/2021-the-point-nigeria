 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE FORMER Governor of Anambra State, and Vice Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 election, Peter Obi, said, on Monday, that the Federal Government would be committing suicide by selling the nation’s assets to fund the budget. Obi, who advocated cutting the cost of governance as against asset sale, said it was not in order to have a budget where recurrent expenditure accounted for between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the total. The PDP chieftain spoke on Arise TV’s morning show on Monday. “You cannot have a budget where your recurrent expenditure is 70 to 80 per cent and you’re funding it with borrowing and sale of assets. You are just committing suicide,” he said. He queried the rationale behind selling of assets today to cater for immediate needs, saying it was like mortgaging the future to cater for the present. “It is like asking me what my take is on selling my property in order to live for today, what my children are going to live with. If you sell the assets today, what are you going to sell tomorrow? What we need to do, as I keep saying, is to cut the cost of governance,” Obi argued. He also faulted the Presidency’s position that Transparency International’s latest poor corruption ranking for Nigeria was an indictment on Nigerians and not the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. According to him, any assessment of a country is about the government and not of the citizens.
