 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE ongoing infidelity scandal involving the General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman, and a former pastor of his church, Mike Davids, has taken a legal dimension. The former Pastor has sued his estranged GO and his church for N2bn for allegedly unlawfully interfering in his “contract of marriage.” He had accused Suleman of committing adultery with his wife, Pastor Faith Edeko, and denying him access to their three children, alleging also that the GO had hypnotised his wife. Pastor Faith, who now heads a branch of the Church at Utako, in Abuja, had, however, described the allegations as falsehood and cheap blackmail, aimed at tarnishing the image of the Apostle. She insisted that she had never slept with the GO and would never contemplate sleeping with a man she said was like her biological father. Recall that the former pastor had also petitioned the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, alleging threat to his life, after which the IGP ordered an investigation into the matter. In the suit filed on Thursday, Davids, who accused Apostle Suleman of destroying his marriage and denying him access to his three children, prayed for an award of punitive and exemplary damages “in the sum of N2bn against the defendants for unlawful interference with the claimant’s contract of marriage and the cost of N2m being the cost of prosecuting this action before this honourable court.” He said he married his wife, pursuant to Section 24 of the Marriage Act at St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Ekpoma, on December 6, 2008, stressing that, by virtue of this, only a High Court could annul the marriage. The former Omega Fire Ministries pastor is also seeking an order of perpetual injunction restraining Apostle Suleman, the church and their agents from gaining access or relating with his wife and three children.
