 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality has awarded two petitioners a total of N20million compensation. The petitioners – Kudirat Obayomi and Hannah Olugbodi – were awarded N10million compensation each on Friday by the panel. It is the first time the panel will be awarding compensation since it commenced sitting last year. Olugbodi had narrated how her leg was damaged by a stray bullet when some officers of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad were chasing a man with tattoo in the Ijeshatedo area of Lagos, in June 2018. The 35-year-old hairdresser, who narrated her ordeal in November 2020, said the man they were chasing was one of those watching a football match at a hotel, Ogun City Hotel, where the said operatives had gone to ask for money to buy fuel for their vehicle. The SARS operatives, she said, did not meet the owner of the hotel when they visited and attempted to arrest the man with tattoo. It was when the other boys with the targeted youth tried to resist the arrest that the operatives reportedly started shooting. Olugbodi said she was hit by their stray bullet at Ijesha market where she had gone to buy pepper. According to her, she managed to give the market women the name of her husband and her address before she passed out. She said she was eventually taken to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and was given four bags of intravenous fluid in the bus because there was no bed space. The event, she said, made her to start walking on crutches. Details later
