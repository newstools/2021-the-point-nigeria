 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics will embark on a nationwide strike from April 6, 2021, over what it described as the culture of neglect by the Federal Government on issues affecting the technological education sub-sector. President, ASUP, Anderson U Ezeibe, declared the impending strike, while speaking with journalists at the end of the 99th meeting of the National Executive Council of the union, held at Hassan Usman Polytechnic, Katsina. He said the industrial action was informed by six key issues affecting polytechnic education in Nigeria, adding that the Federal Government had consistently failed to address the issues over the years. They include non-implementation of the 2010 ASUP/FG agreement, and non-payment of salaries and arrears of the new minimum wage in some state-owned polytechnics, among others. The ASUP President said despite a meeting held with the Federal Government on the pending issues, in October last year, nothing concrete came out of those meetings. According to him, Government has failed to implement the resolutions reached. The union, however, listed 10 conditions to be met in order to avert the April 6 industrial action to include: Implementation of the NEEDS Assessment report of 2014, reconstitution of the Governing Councils of Polytechnics, and the release of promotional arrears in federal polytechnics, among others.
