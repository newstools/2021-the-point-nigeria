 Leicester coach, Bredan Rodgers, has hinted at permitting Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi to link up with Super Eagles for the AFCON qualifier against Benin Republic on March 22. Speaking at a press conference before his side’s Premier League meeting with Brighton & Hove, Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers hinted at the club permitting their Nigeria internationals to report for international duty later this month. It was claimed in the local media that the Super Eagles could be without Premier League quartet Kelechi Iheanacho, Wilfred Ndidi, Alex Iwobi and Semi Ajayi for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Republic of Benin and Lesotho because Nigeria was included in the list of countries from which entry to the United Kingdom is banned. However, according to the UK Government official website, Nigeria and Republic of Benin are not among the seventeen African countries included in the banned – ‘red list’ countries, meaning there’s a high possibility of Iheanacho and Ndidi linking up with the Super Eagles as from March 22nd. When asked about the players going away on internationals, Rodgers told reporters: “We are awaiting more information on it. As we sit here today, we would certainly not want any of our players to be going into any country that is a red-list country, which would mean they don’t play when they come back here. “But as I said we are waiting for more information over the next week or so and then we can be clearer and make a judgement from there.” Iheanacho was involved in Nigeria’s last two Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Sierra Leone but Ndidi was absent due to an injury.
