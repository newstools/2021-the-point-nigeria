 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board is planning to move its headquarters from Bwari Area Council to the Central Business District of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. It is therefore proposing to spend N6bn to acquire a building in the area. The Director, Finance and Administration, Mufutau Bello, disclosed this on Thursday to the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, during its invetigative hearing on revenue generation by Ministries, Departments and Agencies. Bello, who represented the Board at the hearing, said N2bn was being saved every year, since 2018, to realise the project. He noted that the Board had saved up to N5.5bn, adding that the money was in its TSA. He said, “We are proposing to move our central headquarters to the Central Area. We have a plan of over N6 billion but since we don’t collect subvention from the Government for our overhead and capital, every year, from 2018, we have been setting aside N2 billion because our target is N6 billion to be able to acquire our headquarters in the Central Area. “The money is in our TSA. We had a challenge in 2020 because of COVID-19, so we could not realise our budget. So far, we have realised about 5.5 billion.” While commending JAMB for the effort, the Chairman of the Committee, Oluwole Oke, however, advised against allowing the money to lie idle in an account, saying it should be invested. “You cannot keep such money idle in an account. That is poor treasury management,” he noted.
