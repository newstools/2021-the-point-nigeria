 SALIU SALIU GOVERNOR Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has formally welcomed the former Emir of Kano, His Royal Highness, Muhammadu Sanusi II, as the Vice Chairman of the Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency (KADIPA). He thanked the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria for accepting to serve Kaduna, while charging the members of the KADIPA board to step up efforts in making Kaduna State the topmost investment destination in Nigeria. This, he said, they should do, by improving the Ease of Doing Business ranking of the state. El-Rufai spoke during the formal inauguration of the KADIPA board. According to him, the Agency has been a very important and successful vehicle in the investment drive of the state, helping since 2015 to attract over $2.1bn in actual and pledged investments. He added that KADIPA would be competing not just with other states in Nigeria for investments, but also with all emerging markets. He advised the Board not to rest on its oars in its drive to attract businesses to Kaduna State. Recall that the World Bank had rated Kaduna State as the best sub-national in its 2018 Ease of Doing Business ranking. In 2020, the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission also ranked the state as the first in the quantum of foreign direct investment attracted within the first six months of the year. Speaking during the event, the Deputy Governor of Kaduna State and Chairman of the Board, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, assured the governor of the commitment of members to improving on the record of KADIPA, given the calibre of persons on the Board. Sanusi, the Vice Chairman, expressed delight that he was attending the first meeting of the Board since he was made a member. The renowned economist promised to contribute his best to uplifting KADIPA and pledged his commitment to making inputs in the overall policy of the Kaduna State Government.
