 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE LEADER of the Niger Delta Peoples Salvation Force, Asari Dokubo, has declared the formation of the Biafra Customary Government, BCG, and vowed to set up provincial structures. Dokubo, who immediately named officials who would serve as leaders with him, insisted that the Federal Government could not stop him. The development was disclosed in a statement by the Head of Information and Communications, BCG, Uche Mefor. Dokubo said he had dedicated his life, 100 per cent, to the leadership role, noting that it was time for the people of Biafra to take their destinies in their hands. He, however, assured that the agitators would not go to war but would walk to freedom. “Nobody can stop us. Nobody can blockade us as they did in the first war. We’re not going to fight any war with anybody, we’re walking to freedom. We will not shoot any gun with them, they will prepare their weapon but they will have nobody to kill with their weapon,” he stressed. Dokubo noted, “We as people have resolved that as Biafra, it’s time for us to take our destiny in our hands and bring freedom to ourselves and our children and the generation of Biafrans yet unborn. “I hesitate a little but I thank God that it’s time for us to do our duty and our service to motherland, I have accepted this role. I have dedicated my life hundred percent to play this role. “My first act today in taking this position is to name those who would be on the driver’s seat to navigate through this period of tempest, this period of uncertainty with me. “I want to call on our brother, George Onyibe to come on board to join as the secretary of the defacto customary government of the State of Biafra. He will take care of the administrative, day to day administration of the Biafra State.” He added, “I also call on our brother Emeka Emeka Esiri to take care of the legal needs of this nascent government. “My brothers and sisters, the four of us will kick start the process, others will come on board. We want volunteers who are committed, we want volunteers because there is nothing anymore. We are the people who have volunteered to salvage ourselves and the rest of us. “I also call on Biafrans in the various province of the Biafra nations in Aba, Abakiliki, Anang, Awka, Calabar, Degema, Eket, Enough, Nsuka, Ogoja, Oji River, Okigwe, Onitsha, Opobo, Orlu, Owerri, Port Harcourt, Umuahia, Uyo and Yenegoa province. “We are going to proceed to set up provincial structures of government, starting with provincial assemblies and provincial governance and administrators.”
