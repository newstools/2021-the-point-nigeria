 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has condemned a report that its Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, advised the Independent National Electoral Commission not to sell forms to anyone that has a case with the Commission for the 2023 general elections. The Commission described the report as false, saying that its Executive Chairman had neither met with INEC officials nor made any pronouncement remotely related to election since he was appointed. The EFCC said this in a statement on its Facebook page. It said, “The attention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has been drawn to a report currently circulating in the social media, in which the Executive Chairman, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, is quoted as having advised the Independent National Electoral Commission, not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency, pursuant to the 2023 general election. “The Commission wishes to state that the report is false as the Executive Chairman has neither met with INEC officials nor made any pronouncement remotely related to election since he was appointed.” According to the Commission, all Bawa has said, in his two public outings so far, pertain to issues concerning his vision for the EFCC and the outlook for the fight against corruption in Nigeria. “Qualification for elective political offices in Nigeria are clearly stated in the 1999 Constitution and relevant sections of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended ). It  is not the place of the EFCC chairman to determine who runs for an office or otherwise,” it noted. “Members of the public are therefore enjoined to consider this report as another classic case of fake news and discountenance it,” the EFCC said.
