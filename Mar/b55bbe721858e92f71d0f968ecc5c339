 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Presidency has expressed the confidence that nobody can bring down the President Muhammadu Buhari government in spite of the fact that the opposition is exploiting the current challenges facing the country. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, who said this, based his argument on the fact that the government was elected democratically. Shehu spoke on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme on Friday. He said, “I want to assure Nigerians that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is addressing multiple challenges that are facing the country, especially in dealing with security and yet, we are still making progress in agriculture, economy, anti-corruption, which are the key policies that brought the party and the government to office. “It is sad for the country that opposition is exploiting some of these things. It is quite unfortunate and I want to assure that the President remains focused in preserving the security and unity of this country.” Shehu added, “It is an established fact that all nations of the world face problems and what is expected of all well-meaning members of the society is that they should team up with Government so that, together, we will all fight criminality and insurgency. “We accept that dissent is allowed, this is a democracy and people have a right to tell truth to government but we must be careful in doing that. Nobody can bring down the government because this is a government elected democratically.” Advising those who have 2023 ambition to be patient, he said, “People with strong ambitions, wait till four years. In fact, in our case, two more years to go to election and President Buhari will not be a candidate in that election.”
