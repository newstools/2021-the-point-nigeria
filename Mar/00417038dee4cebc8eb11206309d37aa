 FOLASHADE SHIYANBOLA LAGOS State University, Ojo, has again emerged the second best in Nigeria on the 2021 Emerging Economies University Rankings, released by the Times Higher Education (THE) on Tuesday. In a congratulatory message to staff of the institution, acting Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Oyedamola Oke, said the new status of the university was heartwarming. The acting VC noted that it was a further attestation to its quality teaching, research exploits and robust service delivery. He applauded the invaluable and immeasurable contributions of all stakeholders, including the Lagos State Government, members of staff (teaching and non-teaching) and the “world class students” towards the newest ranking of the institution. Oke noted that without the unwavering support and commitment of all stakeholders to the “LASU Project”, the feats would have been unattainable. He also urged members of staff and the students (postgraduate and undergraduate) to be steadfast, continue to keep faith, work and walk with the university management in the desire to claim the university’s pride of place among the comity of universities, not only in Nigeria, but the world at large. The acting VC recalled that Lagos State University had, in 2020, been celebrated as the Second Best University in Nigeria, as ranked by Times Higher Education (THE) World University ranking for 2021.
