 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Tony Fatai Adegoke has moved quickly to dismiss fabricated reports in the local press that claimed that his son, Chelsea goalkeeper Prince Adegoke, shunned the Golden Eaglets training camp in 2019 because of the behavior of some officials. Adegoke Senior has reiterated that the promising glovesman could not attend the training camp in Abuja because of educational and club commitments, adding that his international future lies with Nigeria. The 2003-born Prince Adegoke signed his first professional contract with Chelsea four months ago and was included in his first gameday squad of the season this past weekend after recovering from a knee injury that had kept him on the sidelines. “The article is not from me, I don’t know whoever wrote the article, my name is Tony Fatai Adegoke not Alex Adegoke,” former Victory High School Lagos goalkeeper Tony Adegoke told reporters. “What happened then was that Prince was invited and I can assure you that he was keen to go to the Golden Eaglets camp but looking at the scenario then he’s got his GCSE coming up and he’s got his professional contract to be decided. “I spoke to Chelsea about it and sought advice and they gave me the best option for him. The story today is not true. “My son’s ambition is to play for Nigeria that I know definitely and that’s what we wish for him. “This is exactly what happened; there was no point for him having to travel for the World Cup while his examinations were around the corner”. Born in Farnborough, England, Prince Adegoke joined Chelsea at U13 level from non-league club Langley FC.
