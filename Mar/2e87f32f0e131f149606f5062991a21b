 ABISOYE JOHNSON, ABEOKUTA SPOKESPERSON for Atiku Abubakar, Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 election, Segun Showunmi, has described his wife of over two decades, Oluyemi, as a special gift from God to him. Showunmi, who is preparing for a greater outing in the 2023 election, as evidenced by his ‘Sincerely Set’ teasers across the 20 Local Government Areas of Ogun State, told our correspondent in Abeokuta, the state capital, that attaining the age of 50 was worth celebrating, considering the life expectancy in this part of the world. He said he had been married to his wife, a senior official of the Independent National Electoral Commission, for about 21 years, noting that although throwing parties was not a norm for the family, “this age is special.” “We need to thank God for life and for how far we have gone despite all odds. Yemi has been a very good girl, tolerating my not being around always and being a super manager of the home front. “Her unflinching support and enduring spirit are second to none. I wish her all the best as she steps into the golden era,” the outspoken politician told THE POINT. As part of activities lined up for the special celebration, he said a Holy Communion Service would hold at 8am tomorrow (Tuesday) at their Ibara Housing Estate Abeokuta residence. A dinner in honour of the gorgeous celebrant will also hold at the same venue by 5pm. “All guidelines rolled out by health authorities will be strictly adhered to,” Showunmi said, in reaction to a question on COVID-19 protocols.
