 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Nigeria Governors’ Forum has described as shocking, Saturday’s daylight attack on Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State. The Governor was said to have been attacked by gunmen suspected to be bandits on Saturday, at Tyo Mu, along Makurdi/Gboko road. He was reportedly on his way to Makurdi at about noon, when the gunmen opened fire on his convoy but were eventually repelled by his security men. The NGF said all hands must be on deck to uncover those behind the heinous crime, warning that an attempt to make Benue State ungovernable was unacceptable. The Governors made their position on the matter known in a statement on Sunday, signed by the Chairman of NGF and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi. The NGF said, “The news of the broad daylight attempt to cut short the life of the Governor of Benue State, Dr Samuel Ortom, is shocking and a rude awakening. “All hands must be on deck to uncover the identities of those involved in this heinous crime. “The NGF wishes to state categorically that the attempt to make Benue State ungovernable is unacceptable and will fail woefully.” It noted that, only recently the brother of one of the former governors of the state was also mowed down in cold blood. “This dishonourable and shameful act of resorting to violence, for whatever reason, to eliminate citizens of Benue State by brutal means must not continue,” the Governors declared.
