 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE immediate past Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen, has broken his long silence over his removal from office in 2019 by President Muhammadu Buhari. Onnoghen, who was reportedly removed as a result of his perceived romance with the Peoples Democratic Party and its candidate in the 2019 election, Atiku Abubakar, as opposed to the Federal Government’s official reason, said the Presidency acted based on a rumour that it failed to authenticate. The Code of Conduct Tribunal convicted the former CJN on six counts of false asset declaration, and banned him from holding any public office for the next 10 years. While noting that he heard about the action that was being considered in the Presidency before he was removed, he said he decided not to give it attention because he was sure he did not meet Atiku in Dubai before the general elections. He also stressed that he had never met the former vice president in person all his life. The ex-CJN spoke on Friday at the public presentation of a book, titled, “Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules, 2009: Practice, procedure, forms and precedents,” authored by Ogwu James Onoja, SAN. He wondered why the Presidency chose to act on a rumour without first authenticating same, despite its huge investigative capacities. Recalling how he was removed, Onnoghen said the situation got to a height when the Code of Conduct Tribunal began his trial even before he was invited or accused of any wrongdoing. He said, in the course of the trial, when parties had joined issues, an ex-parte application was brought in suddenly. “What followed was my illegal and unlawful suspension as the CJN,” Onnoghen recalled.
