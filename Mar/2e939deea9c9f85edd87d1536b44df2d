 ABISOYE JOHNSON YORUBA activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho, has distanced himself from a statement credited to him that angry Yoruba youths will attack the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, over his recent position on Nigeria’s unity. This is despite the fact that his spokesperson, Olayomi Koiki, gave the threat of an impending attack on the monarch in a viral video seen by THE POINT. He had threatened that those agitating for the Oduduwa nation would soon attack the Alake in his palace, including other Yoruba monarchs who were not in support of their struggle. But Senior Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to Igboho, Dapo Salami, dissociated his boss from the statement, which had drawn criticisms from across Yorubaland, saying Koiki was strictly on his own. He said, “Chief Sunday Igboho has nothing to do with this declaration by Koiki, though Koiki is Igboho’s spokesman but on this particular one, Chief is not in support. “The Alake of Egbaland is a major leader in Yorubaland whom we honour and have so much reverence for. Igboho will never say he wants to go and invade his palace. “Koiki came in from the United Kingdom so he does not understand some things. We are not for violence, we are not going to invade any Oba’s Palace. We respect them all. They are our fathers and we will never disrespect them.” The Alake of Egbaland had, last week, canvassed for the continued unity of Nigeria, stressing that it was in the best interest of all Nigerians to remain one, regardless of the current challenges. The retired Brigadier-General warned that the country could not afford another civil war or absorb the huge number of Nigerians that could be displaced in the event of one.
