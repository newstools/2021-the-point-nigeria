 BANYO TEMITAYO THE Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria, on Tuesday, said the market capitalisation of listed equities on the Nigerian Stock Exchange fell by 1.11 per cent to N20.82trillion on February 26, 2021, from N21.06 trillion on December 31, 2020. The N240billion decline was attributed largely to investor sell-off, which continued to cause price depreciation of large and medium capitalised stocks. This was disclosed by the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, in the Communique 135 of the MPC meeting, which he presented on Tuesday. He said this just as the MPC retained benchmark interest rate at 11.5 per cent, following low consumer spending. The CBN Governor said, “The Committee noted the weak performance in the equities market despite the recent increased patronage by domestic investors. “The All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalisation (MC) continued to decline due to portfolio switching from equities to fixed income securities, reflecting the perception of improved yields at the long end of the yield curve.” He stated, “All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 1.17 per cent to 39,799.89 points on February 26, 2021 from 40,270.72 on December 31, 2020. Similarly, Market Capitalization (MC) fell by 1.11 per cent to N20.82 trillion on February 26, 2021 from N21.06 trillion on December 31, 2020. “This was attributed largely to investor sell-off, which continued to cause price depreciation of large and medium capitalized stocks.” According to Emefiele, the MPC noted the performance of the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) of the DMBs, which showed a Capital Adequacy Ratio of 15.2 per cent, Non-Performing Loans ratio of 6.3 per cent and Liquidity Ratio of 40.5 per cent, as at February 2020. He said the NPL ratio remained above the prudential benchmark of five per cent, adding that the NPC urged the CBN to sustain its regulatory measures to bring it below the prudential benchmark. Emefiele added, “The Committee noted with satisfaction the improvement in the level of external reserves, which stood at US$36.46 billion at end-February 2021, compared with US$34.94 billion at end-January 2021. “This reflects the recent upsurge in crude oil prices on the backdrop of the renewed optimism on the successful deployment of COVID-19 vaccines across the globe.” The MPC, however, said the medium-term outlook for both the domestic and global economies indicated cautious optimism. “This is premised on the expectation of sustained policy support and successful deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines around the globe and its effectiveness in ensuring herd immunity,” the communique said.
