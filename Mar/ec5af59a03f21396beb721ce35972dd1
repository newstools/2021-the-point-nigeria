 BY REBECCA AJANI A 29-year old man, identified as Ikumuyi Isreal, has been arraigned before an Ondo State Magistrate’s Court in Akure for raping a minor to death. The suspect, a farmer, allegedly lured the victim to his room, promising to give her N100, before allegedly perpetrating the wicked act. The incident was said to have occurred on February 2, 2021, at Akinfosile Village, in Ondo State. It was learnt that the victim, identified as Esther Friday, died from suffocation when the suspect tried to stop her from shouting for help by using a cloth to gag her. During interrogation, the suspect was said to have confessed that he mistakenly suffocated her with the cloth. Isreal said, “I didn’t mean to rape her, but when she slept by my side on the bed, I felt aroused and decided to quickly have sexual intercourse with her. I did not force her to have sex. We were together on the bed. But my penis did not penetrate despite all my efforts; It did not fully enter. “I covered her mouth with my cover cloth so that she could not raise alarm. She was crying, but nobody could hear her or come to her aid.” Police Prosecutor, Inspector Uloh Goodluck, confirmed to the court that the suspect lured the victim into his room, promising to give her N100. He said that the offence committed by the suspect contravened sections 316, 319(1) of the Criminal Code Cap 37, Vol. 1 Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria 2006. The Prosecutor therefore urged the court to remand the suspect in prison custody, pending the outcome of legal advice from the Department of Public Prosecution. The accused however had no counsel. Presiding Magistrate, N. T Aladejana, remanded him in the Owo Correctional Centre pending the outcome of DPP advice, and adjourned the case to May 3, 2021 for mentioning.
