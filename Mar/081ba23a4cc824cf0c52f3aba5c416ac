 TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Police in Osun State have arrested no fewer than 10 suspected cultists after two rival cult groups attacked themselves and killed three people in Osogbo, the state capital. Some suspected cultists belonging to Eiye and Aiye confraternities had, on Sunday, engaged themselves in a supremacy battle, which led to the death of the three persons. But a statement issued by Yemi Opalola, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, on Monday, claimed that only two persons died and that one other was injured and hospitalised. Opalola said, “The supremacy battle between Eiye and Aiye cult confraternities led to the death of one Akinwale Rotimi around Arikamlamu area of Osogbo and one Sogo Owonikoko, popularly called ‘Marley’ around Obate area, Osogbo, while one other injured member is still receiving treatment in the hospital. “Upon the report of the matter, Police, together with other security agencies, including local security outfits in the state, swiftly swung into action, which led to the arrest of some of the cult members who will be presented to the members of the public soon before proper prosecution in the law court.” The PPRO said that the Police got a tip-off that some other suspected cult group assembled in a hotel and wanted to launch an attack on Monday. “In another development, upon a tip-off received from the member of public that some suspected cult members are planning to carry out their nefarious activities around Ikire axis; Police operatives promptly moved in and arrested ten suspected members of the cult groups in a hotel,” Opalola added. The Police said intensive manhunt had been launched to ensure that every member of the groups was arrested before another attack.
