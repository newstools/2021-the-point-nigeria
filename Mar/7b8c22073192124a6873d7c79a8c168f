 FOLASHADE KEHINDE CHAIRMAN of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa, on Wednesday, disclosed that the Commission had identified about N70 billion fraud perpetrated through the fuel subsidy regime in Nigeria. Of this figure, he revealed that a total of N20bn had been recovered by the EFCC. Bawa disclosed this to journalists after testifying in the Nadabo Energy fuel subsidy trial at the Ikeja High Court, in Lagos. He however noted that the fuel subsidy trials were proceeding at a slow pace, noting that the EFCC would do everything possible to pursue all the cases in court rigorously. “We have identified fraud of about N70 billion perpetrated through the fuel subsidy. So far, the commission has recovered N20 billion from the N70 billion and we are working to recover the rest,” the EFCC boss said. “We are worried about the slow pace of some of the fuel subsidy cases we charged to court since 2012, when investigations were concluded. Criminal trials are guided by statutes and procedures and we will continue to follow them,” he added. Bawa noted that he had been a witness in this particular trial involving Nadabo Energy for five years, saying, hopefully, the commission would get a conviction. He also disclosed that the EFCC was working tirelessly to arrest an alleged fuel subsidy suspect. The suspect, he said, was arraigned in 2012, but jumped bail and left the country.
