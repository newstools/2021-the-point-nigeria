 BY SALIU SALIU THE Arewa Consultative Forum has asked Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State to reveal the identities of criminals behind the kidnap of students of Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe. The ACF said it was shocked to learn through the media that the Governor told 17 Emirs, who paid a sympathy visit to him over the abduction, that he knew the identities of the kidnappers. The Governor reportedly said Nigerians would be shocked if he revealed the identities of these people. National Chairman, ACF, Audu Ogbe, in a statement on Tuesday, charged the Governor to reveal the identities and “let Nigerians be shocked or even the heavens fall.” He said, “We also ask the security agencies to question the governor on the identifies of the criminals he is trying to hide. If he refuses to disclose their identities, he must be treated as an accomplice to the criminal act of kidnapping. “The ACF has been embarrassed by the spate of kidnappings especially of school children spreading like wildfire all over the North. People in positions of authority that will help us out of this mess like Governor Mutawalle must stop embarrassing the North and country with careless statements on a serious issue like the kidnappings of school children.” “Zamfara State and the north are way behind the rest of the country in educational development. The serial kidnappings of school pupils in the North will only worsen a bad and unacceptable state of education in the North,” the ACF said.
