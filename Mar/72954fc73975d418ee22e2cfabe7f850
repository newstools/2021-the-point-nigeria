 BY BANYO TEMITAYO ACCESS Bank Plc will reward customers with N5 on every $1 received from their loved ones or associates in the diaspora. This is in line with the Central Bank of Nigeria’s Naira4Dollar scheme, which is targeted at encouraging the inflow of diaspora remittances into the country. The Banks said it would pay the N5 for every dollar cash back to customers irrespective of their preference to receive funds as US dollars cash pick-up, over the counter, or as direct transfers into their domiciliary accounts. Executive Director, Retail Banking, Access Bank, Victor Etuokwu, said, “Remittance services are a key aspect of our economy and it is still vibrant and viable today because people still take care of family members, loved ones, friends and invest at home, even as they live abroad. “As part of our promise to create value and meet the needs of our customers, we are happy to announce that our customers can now receive the N5 for every $1 incentive, at any of our branches nationwide when their loved ones or associates send funds from the diaspora.”
