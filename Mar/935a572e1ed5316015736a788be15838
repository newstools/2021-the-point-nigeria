 BY REBECCA AJANI GOVERNOR Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has ordered the indefinite suspension of activities of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in the state with immediate effect. In line with this directive, which is the second hard stance taken against the union in one week, all NURTW members are to vacate all motor parks across the state with immediate effect. This was disclosed on Tuesday by the Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties and Strategy to the Governor, Doyin Odebowale. He however noted that the indefinite suspension would not affect RTEAN. The decision followed the clash at the Old Garage on Tuesday morning, which claimed one life. THE POINT had reported that there were heavy gunshots at the Old Garage, when suspected thugs stormed the garage to attack members of a faction of the NURTW in the state. One person was reportedly killed in the chaos that ensued while two others were said to have sustained severe injuries. Recall that two members of one of the factions, identified as Omoniyi Oni, popularly called Eniba; and Wasiu Ibrahim had been attacked in Akure on Sunday by thugs said to be loyalists of the former leader of the union. They were said to have been attacked at a barbing salon around the Owode area of Akure. However, Akeredolu said the indefinite suspension of the activities of the NURTW was as a result of the unruly and uncultured behaviour of the union leaders. He said the Government would not tolerate violent attacks on innocent citizens.
