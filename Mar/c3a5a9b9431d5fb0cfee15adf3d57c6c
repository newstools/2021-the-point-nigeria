 BY UMMU ABUBAKAR RESIDENTS of Tanke area of Ilorin, Kwara State capital, were thrown into grief on Wednesday night, when four children of the same parents and their mother were burnt to death in an inferno. The incident occurred at the residence of the deceased, located at Ifesowapo Community, behind ‘F’ Division Police Station, in Tanke. The surviving child of the family was not burnt to death with his siblings, having been reportedly admitted at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital for an undisclosed ailment. Their father was also not at home as of the time of the unfortunate incident, it was learnt. The fire was reportedly caused by candle light, which the victims used following the week-long power outage in the area. The candlelight was said to have caught other items in the house while the victims were asleep, after burning out. It was in the process that the four children and their mother were burnt to death in their room. As of the time the men of the state FIRE Service got to the scene, the deed had already been done, it was gathered. Chairman, Ifesowapo Community, Awodun Yinka, told journalists at the scene of the incident that the residents did not know about the incident on time.

By the time we saw the smoke and rushed to the apartment to see what was happening, thick smoke had already enveloped the apartment and we could not rescue any member of the family. “It was then we made the distress calls to the office of the state fire service but by time the they arrived, the havoc had been done.”
