 BY BANYO TEMITAYO THE Military Pensions Board has described the allegation of a missing N2.5 billion military pensions fund as outrageous and spurious. The Public Relations Officer of the Board, Flt.-Lt. Olayinka Lawal, urged pensioners and Nigerians, as a whole, to disregard, in totality, what he described as deliberate falsehood being peddled by online and social media news outlets. He said in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, that the misleading publication alleged that the money was misappropriated by the MPB in conjunction with some “top military chiefs”. Lawal, while assuring the public that the military pensions administration was in safe hands, said, “The board has no link with the names published in the false publication. There are no records of the names listed in the publication at the Military Pensions Board. “The MPB has chosen to set the records straight and defend itself in the court of public opinion. Nigerians are encouraged to find out from qualified military pensioners across the country on the promptness of the payment of their entitlements.” “As at today, MPB does not owe any pensioner monthly pensions and will continue to work assiduously to ensure that the standards are maintained,” he added. The spokesperson assured retirees that the Board was committed to sustaining the prompt payment of all entitlements of military retirees or their next-of-kins in a transparent and accountable manner.
