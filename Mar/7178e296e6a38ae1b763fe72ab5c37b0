 BY FRANCIS KADIRI, ABUJA THE African Democratic Congress, on Tuesday, lamented the worsening insecurity situation in the country, saying that the All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government had failed to keep its promises of adequate security and economic development. Director of Communications and Strategy, ADC, Ifenla Oligbinde, who expressed the concern while delivering the first quarter accountability report of the ADC, at the Global Campus and Headquarters of the party in Abuja, emphasised the need for government to be accountable to the electorate. She noted that the solution to the country’s economic and security challenges was simply that “President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress should fulfil the campaign promises of national security and economic development they made.” The party said the economy was on the brink of collapse, and warned that it would collapse if government continued to fail in its responsibility to take decisive steps. “The Nigerian economy is already going down the drain, and it will finally collapse if urgent steps are not taken to address the worsening security situation,” Oligbinde said. Discussing the impact of Nigeria’s troubled economy on the ability of local Non-Governmental Organisations to access foreign loans and grants, Oligbinde said, “NGOs usually write applications to international organisations for grants and loans, but the current economic and security situation of the country does not encourage international organisations to give fund aid to Nigeria because the insecurity in the country does not guarantee conducive environment for activities of NGOs.” “It is a well-known fact that insecurity discourages foreign investors,” she said, adding that the impact of the unaddressed security challenges had serious consequences for Nigeria.
