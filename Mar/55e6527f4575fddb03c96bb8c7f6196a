 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Manchester United dare-devil winger Shola Shoretire has been named Premier League 2 Player of the Month for February 2021. The England youth international of Nigerian descent saw off competition from Manchester City duo Liam Delap and James McAtee, Blackburn Rovers’ Connor McBride, Everton’s Nathan Broadhead, Leeds United’s Cody Drameh and Stoke City’s Ethon Varian to win the accolade. The 17-year-old is the first Nigeria-eligible youngster to win the Premier League 2 POTM this season. Shoretire made his Premier League debut against Newcastle United on February 21 and four days later became the youngest player in history to feature for Manchester United in European competition when he came off the bench against Real Sociedad. He was involved in five goals last month, netting his first competitive hat-trick for a Manchester United team and it came in a Premier League 2 clash against Blackburn Rovers and provided an assist in that game on February 5, before scoring in a 3-0 home win against Arsenal a week later. Shoretire was an unused substitute in recent Premier League matches against Crystal Palace, Manchester City and West Ham United.
