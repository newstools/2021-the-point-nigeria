 BY RIMI ALIU KINGPINS of major bandits groups operating in Niger State, on Friday, held a meeting to discuss the modalities of a peace dialogue with the state government. It was however learnt that the state government was not represented at the bandits’ meeting, which was said to have held in Shiroro Local Government area of the state. The bandits decided to meet ahead of a planned meeting with Government, following the state government’s recent statement that it would meet with them to deliberate on ensuring last peace in the state. Secretary to the Niger State Government, Ahmed Ibrahim Matene, confirmed that the meeting held. He however said the state government was not represented at the meeting because it was meant strictly for the bandits. He said, “One of the commanders called for a meeting to know how they would stretch the hands of dialogue with the state government so that there would be peace in the state. “It was their meeting and they held it and they talked about how we can have peace in the state. And how the banditry activities in the state will end.” “When they are through with that, we will interface with them again to see some resolutions that government can also leverage,” Matane stressed. He noted that there was still a chance for willing bandits to drop their arms and embrace a legitimate lifestyle in the ongoing negotiations.
