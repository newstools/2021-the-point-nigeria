 BY ADEMETO ADELEKAN THE All Progressives Congress in Edo State has raised the alarm over the increasing number of mentally deranged people roaming the streets of Benin City and other parts of the state. The APC called on the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led Peoples Democratic Party government to rid the streets of the lunatics and set up a process of rehabilitation for them. The party said the situation might be linked to what it described as the collapse of rehabilitation facilities, owing allegedly to neglect and poor funding by the state government. In a statement signed by the Assistant State Publicity Secretary of the party, Victor Osehobo, the APC also attributed the development to the absence of a functional Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development in the state. The statement read in part, “The unending infighting in the PDP government, led by Mr Obaseki, which has deprived the State of a Cabinet of Civil Commissioners and Special Advisers, has not helped matters. “Forget the claims by the government about its so-called benevolence to healthy citizens, even in the peak of the Covid19 pandemic. Don’t these people also need government attention in the area of clothing, feeding and healthcare? “Only a people-centred government knows that it has a duty to periodically organise a massive exercise to get these people off the streets, or even realise that such moves would also help a great deal in strengthening the already precarious security situation in the state.”
