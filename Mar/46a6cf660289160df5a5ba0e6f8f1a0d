 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Police have arrested five more suspects in relation to the gruesome murder of Mrs. Funke Olakunri, daughter of Pa Reuben Fasoranti, National Leader of Pan Yoruba Socio-Political Group, Afenifere. This brings the total number of suspects arrested so far to nine. Olakunri, 58, was murdered between Kajola and Ore, along Ondo-Ore Road in Ondo State, on July 12, 2019. The suspects that were arrested include Lawal Mazaje, 40, from Felele, Kogi State; Adamu Adamu, 50, from Jada in Adamawa State; Mohammed Usman, 26, from Illela, Sokoto State; and Auwal Abubakar, 25, from Shinkafi, Zamfara State. Recall that four suspects had earlier been arrested in Edo, Ondo and Ogun states, in April 2020, by the Police. They include Muhammed Shehu, 26; Mazaje Lawal, 40; Adamu Adamu, 60; and Awalu Abubakar, 25. The suspects were arraigned on a three-count charge, bordering on conspiracy to kill, murder and kidnapping at an Akure High Court presided over by Justice Bode Adegbehingbe. Director of Public Prosecution, Grace Olowoporoku, disclosed the arrest of the fresh suspects by men of the Force CID at the resumed hearing of the case. According to her, the additional suspects were arrested because their names kept coming up during investigation. She, therefore, appealed to the court to adjourn the case briefly so that the prosecution could conclude investigation of the five suspects. In view of this, trial judge, Justice Bode Adegbehingbe, adjourned the case till April 27, 29, 30 and May 5, 2021, for continuation of hearing. The charges were interpreted to the four suspects in Hausa language. It reads, “That Mohammed Shehu, Mazaje Lawal, Adamu Adamu, and Awalu Abubakar and others, now at large, on or before the 12th day of July, 2019 at about 0900hrs at Tollgate along Ore/ljebu Ode Expressway, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, did conspire together to commit felony to wit: Murder and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 516 Of Criminal Code, Cap 37; Vol. I, Laws of Ondo State 2006. “That Mohammed Shehu, Mazaje Lawal, Adamu Adamu, and Awalu Abubakar and others, now at large, on or before the 12th day of July, 2019, at about 0900hrs at Tollgate along Ore/Ijebu Ode Expressway, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, did murder one Olufunke Olakunrin (Nee Fasoranti) ‘f’ aged 58 years, contrary to and punishable under Section 316 of the Criminal Code, Cap 37, Vol. 1, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006. “That Mohammed Shehu Usman, Mazaje Lawal, Adamu Adamu, and Awalu Abubakar and others now at large on or before the 12‘“ day of July, 2019 at about 0900hrs at Tollgate along Ore/ljebu Ode Expressway, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, did murder one Ogunbiyi Matthew ‘m’ aged 65-year contrary to and punishable under Section 316 of the Criminal code, Cap36, Vol. 1 Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006.” The four defendants pleaded not guilty.
