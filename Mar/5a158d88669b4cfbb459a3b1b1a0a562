 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE SOME stakeholders in the Nollywood industry have said they will sensitise their teeming followers to vote for Governor Yahaya Bello as President in 2023. The stakeholders, led by Seun Oloketuyi, said, during a visit to the Governor on Tuesday, that they would be actively involved in ensuring that a youth emerged President. According to them, Nollywood is the second largest employer of labour and has a great role to play ahead of 2023. Oloketuyi said, “Nollywood is the second employer of labour today. We believe that ahead of the 2023 elections, Nollywood has a great role to play as most of the stars have very huge followers which makes them influential in what they say. “Going into 2023, the Nollywood stars have said they will not just sit down and fold their hands but sensitise their followers on voting for a youth as President in person of governor Yahaya Bello.” He said this just as the Director-General, Best of Nollywood, Segun Okeowo, sought the Governor’s approval for Kogi State to host the 13th edition of the BON Award in November. Governor Bello, in his response, agreed that the creative industry had contributed immensely to the growth of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product, youth empowerment, as well as showcasing Nigeria to the world. He said he would listen to their call for him to run for 2023 presidency but also urged them to be actively involved in politics. On growth so far in Kogi State, he said, “We have been able to discover that we have these solid minerals, but we are establishing a University that is coming up this year that will be second to none in Nigeria, where we are going to develop our knowledge; where our solid minerals will no longer leave Kogi State in raw form again. That is what we need in Nigeria.”
