 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI JUSTICE Elvis Ngene has emerged the 5th Chief Judge of Ebonyi State. Swearing in the new Chief Judge who is the most senior among all serving judges in the state, Governor David Umahi pledged that his government would not interfere unduly with the judiciary arm of government in the state. Umahi advocated for more training for Magistrates in the state to ensure effective justice delivery and promised to support the new CJ to ensure quick dispensation of justice in the state. The immediate past Peoples Democratic Party chairman, Nwebonyi Onyekachi, was also sworn in as the state Commissioner for Capital City Development. Governor Umahi said Nwebonyi was trusted and that he left the PDP because he was a man of great character. In an acceptance speech, the new CJ thanked the state government, saying it was the first time a Chief Judge was appointed and sworn in without working in acting capacity even for one day. On his part, Nwebonyi reaffirmed his resolve to serve without compromise.
