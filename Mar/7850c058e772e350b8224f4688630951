 REBECCA AJANI/span> THE Ondo State Government has directed the immediate past Deputy Governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi, to return official vehicles and other assets attached to his former office. Agboola had been at loggerheads with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu before the election that returned the latter for a second term in office. He dumped the All Progressives Congress for the Peoples Democratic Party, and later defected from the PDP to Zenith Labour Party, when he could not secure the governorship ticket of the main opposition party for the October 10, 2020 election in Ondo State. He was given the ZLP ticket but lost to Akeredolu, as the 2nd runner up in the race. However, the former deputy governor, it was learnt, had not returned the official cars he was given as deputy governor, even after Akeredolu had been sworn in for a fresh term in the state, along with his new deputy. He is said to be in possession of one Land Cruiser SUV and two New Toyota Hilux. Ajayi was directed to return the vehicles in a letter addressed to him, dated February 16, 2021. He was asked to submit to the General Administration Department of the Governorâ€™s office, all government properties in his possession, including vehicles and other movable and immovable assets on it before 23rd February, 2021. When contacted, the former deputy governor said he had not seen a copy of the letter asking him to return the vehicles, adding, however, that he would respond appropriately.
