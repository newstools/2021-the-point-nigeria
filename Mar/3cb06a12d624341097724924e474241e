 BANYO TEMITAYO TELECOMS data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, on Thursday, revealed a decline in total number of subscribers who were active on voice in the fourth quarter of 2020. While a total of 204,601,313 subscribers were active on voice in the fourth quarter, 205,252,058 subscribers were active in the third quarter of 2020, the NBS said. This represented 0.32 per cent decline. Internet subscription in the country, however, increased by 1.84 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020. Analysts have however linked the drop in subscribers who were active on voice call to the increase in the number of people who rely on Internet or WhatsApp calls. This, they said, might also account for the increase in Internet subscription.
