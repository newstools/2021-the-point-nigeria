 REBECCA AJANI THE Police in Ondo State have arrested a man who allegedly strangled his wife, simply identified as Wayesola, to death in Ondo Town. The man was said to have perpetrated the dastardly act while the deceased was asleep at their Salvation Army Street, Odojimu residence in Ondo. Their daughter, a five-year-old primary school pupil (name withheld) revealed how her mother was killed by her father. She told the Police that she saw her father turning her late mother’s neck and the latter struggling to free herself from his grip when she woke up at about 5am to go to the toilet. The couple, according to neighbours, had a heated argument the night before the incident. The five-year-old daughter of the couple said her mother was eventually overpowered by her father, which led to her death. The suspect was arrested, following the little girl’s revelation. The little girl was also said to have told police investigators that her father threatened to kill her when she wanted to raise the alarm. She reportedly later saw her lifeless mother beside her father on the bed, after which neighbours entered and covered her up. It was learnt that neighbours, on finding out what had happened, locked the man up in the room with the victim and alerted her brother through a phone call. “They locked the man up with the lifeless body of his wife in the room and called her brother, who alerted the Police,” a source said. Police Public Relations Officer in the state,
Tee- Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident. He said the matter had been transferred to the state CID for further investigation, assuring that the man would be charged for murder after investigation.
