 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE FORMER Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to focus on addressing the worsening insecurity in the country rather than receiving those he described as “political wanderers” in the Villa. Fayose was reacting to the visit of a former Governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel; and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole, to the Villa on Monday, in preparation for their inauguration as members of the APC Contact/Strategy Committee today. The former governor, who spoke on his verified Twitter handle on Tuesday, said Nigerians were more interested in their wellbeing, especially in the area of security, not in the President receiving “recycled politicians”. He said instead of involving himself in a fruitless activity, Buhari should make himself available to Nigerians who could help solve the unending financial and security challenges in the country, among others. Fayose tweeted, “Nigerians are not interested in the President receiving political wanderers in the Villa. They are more interested in their well-being, especially security. They want to see a president who’s proactive in handling affairs of the country, rather than receiving recycled politicians. “Most importantly, Nigerians are not interested in how many politicians that decamp to APC, which is already a dead party.” “The President should rather make himself available to Nigerians who can help solve our unending financial and security challenges amongst others. Above all, I wish the President knows how disappointed Nigerians are about him and his failed promises,” he added.
