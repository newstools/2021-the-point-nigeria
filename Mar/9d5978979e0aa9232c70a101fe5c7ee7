 SALIU SALIU NO fewer than 19 people died in a ghastly road accident at the Kateri axis of the Kaduna-Abuja highway late Sunday. The accident was reportedly caused by a combination of speeding and tyre bust, which led to loss of control of the vehicle by the driver. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna, Samuel Aruwan, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. He said the crash, which occurred late Sunday evening, involved a commercial DAF trailer, which veered into the bush after the driver lost control. He said, “A total of fifty-three (53) people were involved in the crash; 16 of these died on the spot, with three others later confirmed dead. “Thirty-four (34) sustained injuries which ranged from bruises and cuts to dislocations and head injuries. They were evacuated from the scene by personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps.” According to him, the survivors are receiving treatment at the hospital. It was learnt that officials of the Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs visited the site of the crash to ascertain the report of events and avoid misrepresentations of the incident. The driver, Auwal Idris, was quoted as saying that most of the passengers on board the ill-fated trailer were picked at Kara, by a filling station in Lagos. Some of them were to alight at Zaria, while Kano was meant to be the final destination, he said. Governor Nasir El-Rufai has expressed shock and sadness at the incident and prayed for the repose of the souls of those who perished in the crash. He condoled with the families of those who lost their lives and wished the injured victims speedy recovery. The Governor however commended the personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps for their swift response and prompt evacuation of the casualties from the scene. He enjoined drivers on the route to exercise caution at all times and avoid potentially dangerous driving practices like speeding.
