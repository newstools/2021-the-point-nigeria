 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO OSUN State Government has shut down about 23 private schools for operating below standard. The Government accused the affected schools of teaching in dirty environments, recruiting unqualified teachers and operating without licence. The State Commissioner for Education, Folorunso Oladoyin, while supervising the closure of the schools on Tuesday, said the sealing off of the affected schools was part of government’s efforts to sanitise the education sector for better results. Some of the offences that necessitated the closure of the schools, according to him, included “dirty teaching environment, unqualified teachers, non-renewal of licences and operating without licence”, among others. After the seal-off excercise across the state, the government said it would not relent in its efforts at giving quality education to Osun students because they are the future of the state. Oladoyin noted that the Governor Gboyega Oyetola-led administration would ensure that students in the state always got the best in terms of quality education. He said agents of the state education ministry would continue to scout the state in order to fish out more mushroom and substandard private schools. The Commissioner stressed that the state government was determined to produce graduates who were critical thinkers and globally competitive. He therefore advised private schools that were not properly registered with the state’s Ministry of Education to do so as soon as possible, saying Government would not condone any act that could sabotage its resolve to give Osun students the best. The sealed schools are Hephzibah Kiddies, Ejigbo; Najeemdeen Model Schools, Ejigbo; Favour of God Secondary School, Okinni; and Omolara Nursery and Primary School, Iwo, among others.
