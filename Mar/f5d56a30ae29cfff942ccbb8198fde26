 BANYO TEMITAYO AFRICAN Export-Import Bank has approved a seven-year $350 million loan facility for the OCP Group, the world’s largest phosphate mining and leading fertiliser company. The facility, according to a statement by the Group, is to support the expansion plans of the OCP Group across Africa. President, Afreximbank, Prof. Benedict Oramah, was quoted as saying that, through the partnership with a major player in the fertiliser industry, and with a strong presence across Africa, the bank was fulfilling its mandate of facilitating export development in the continent and promoting intra-African trade and investments. “This is an important transaction, which supports the development of Africa’s agricultural capacity. OCP Group’s products, which are tailored to the needs of African farmers, will generate broad and deep improvements to the continent’s ability to compete in international agricultural markets,” Oramah said. “This facility also has symbolic value, as it marks the beginning of a productive and close relationship between Afreximbank and OCP Group,” he added. He said the Bank was delighted to announce the facility, “as the first demonstration of the strong relationship the Bank enjoys with Morocco.”
