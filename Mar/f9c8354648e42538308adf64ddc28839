 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE FOUNDER of the Living Faith Church, popularly known as Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, has advised Muslims to leave mission schools in Kwara State and look for hijab-wearing schools for their children. The influential pastor described as a nasty development, a situation in Kwara where Muslims were asking students in Christian schools to wear hijab and the Church was resisting it. Oyedepo was reacting to the lingering controversy over the wearing of hijab in grant-aided schools in Ilorin, which had led to continuous confrontation between the Christian and Muslim communities. The Kwara State Government had shut 10 schools in February over the crisis, but reopened them on Monday, giving reasons why Muslim female students should be allowed to wear hijab in the affected schools. There was, however, a clash between the Muslims and Christians, especially at Baptist Secondary School, Surulere; and Cherubim and Seraphim College, Sabo-Oke in Ilorin, when students wearing hijab were not allowed to enter the schools’ premises. Reacting in a viral video seen by The Point, Oyedepo said, “It is such a nasty development in Kwara State where Muslims are asking their students in our schools to wear Hijab, and the church said no. “I have never seen a place in my life where a tenant will be decreeing for the landlord…We have never shown the world the other side of God. God is not a toy. Our God is a consuming fire. Let us show them the consuming fire of God. They need to know.” “Leave the schools for the owners, go to your schools. Is there any fight? Stop putting fingers in the eyes of others,” he added. He warned that the church was a time-bomb, noting that “when God turns his back on anybody or any system, that system is grounded.” “My advice is: leave the schools for the owners, find your own schools, men and women can wear hijab there. Stop putting your fingers in the eyes of others when they are not blind,” Oyedepo declared.
