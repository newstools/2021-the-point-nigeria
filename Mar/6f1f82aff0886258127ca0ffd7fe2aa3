 BY AYO ESAN THE Peoples Democratic Party has said that the pervading peace, harmony and unity of purpose that characterised the conduct of its zonal congresses in the North East and South East geo-political zones last Friday and Saturday, further showcased its readiness to take Nigeria  out of the quagmire into which it has been sunk by the ruling All Progressives Congress. The PDP, in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan on Sunday, asserted that the peaceful conduct of its zonal congresses showed the sharp contrast between the PDP and the APC whose activities were
always enmeshed in selfish contestations, lust for power, bloody clashes, killings and overheating of the national polity. It said, “The harmony in the PDP as one indivisible family is a direct product of  our all-inclusive system, strict adherence to the principle of internal democracy as well as putting the welfare of the people first and above personal interests. “Such disposition, which is completely lacking in the APC, is the only way to restore good governance and return our dear nation to the path of peace, unity, national cohesion and economic prosperity.” The party congratulated and commended its members in the South East and North East, particularly the new entrants, for the successful conduct of the exercises and urged all members of the party across the country to continue to work together “as the nation looks forward to our great party for direction and solution at this critical time.”
