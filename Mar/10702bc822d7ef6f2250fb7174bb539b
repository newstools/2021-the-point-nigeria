 AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI THE Governor David Umahi-led Ebonyi State Government has denied involvement in the sealing off of a five-star hotel belonging to the poineer Governor of the state, Sam Egwu. Grace Court Hotels, located at Nna Street, Abakaliki, the state capital, owned by Egwu, was recently shut by operatives of the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency, for allegedly harbouring drug traffickers. There were, however, rumours of an alleged plot by the Umahi administration to plant implicating objects in properties owned by the Peoples Democratic Party’s stakeholders in the state and use same as subterfuge to clamp down on such properties. In a swift reaction, the Ebonyi State Government said the allegation was not only baseless but unfounded, adding that it was the handiwork of mischief makers. The Commissioner for Internal Security and Border Peace, Stanley Okoro-Emegha, said this in a telephone interview with our Correspondent. He wondered when the job of the NDLEA became that of the state government. Okoro-Emegha said, “What sort of stupid and dirty allegation is this? What business does Ebonyi State Government have with the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency? Is there any connection? “What has the state government got to do with the running of the NDLEA? Are they not doing their job? This agency of Federal Government is charged with the responsibility of investigating and arresting drug dealers and that’s what it has done and will still do. “It is the duty of the state government to do that? What kind of allegation is that, that’s coming from mischief makers and those who hate good things? “Doesn’t Senator Obinna Ogba have hotels in this state? Don’t other National Assembly members have investments in this state? How many times have their investments been shut down by either the state government or the NDLEA? Please, regard this allegation as unfounded and baseless.”
