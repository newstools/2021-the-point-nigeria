 BY REBECCA AJANI ONE of the most dreaded herdsmen reportedly terrorising Ibarapa and Oke-Ogun communities in Oyo State has been arrested. The man, identified as Iskilu Wakili, was said to have been apprehended in Igangan, Ibarapa North Local Government Area, on Sunday, by men of the Odua Peoples Congress. Wakili, it was alleged, had a hand in the abductions, killings and other criminal activities perpetrated in the communities. His arrest was confirmed by Kehinde Aderemi, media aide of the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams. Commending the OPC for the arrest, National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin, in a statement on Sunday, said, “Afenifere gives tremendous commendation to OPC under Iba Gani Adams for the arrest of iskilu Wakili, a Fulani bandit who has been spreading terror on our people in Igboho area and the Nigerian Police and other security agencies unable to do anything about him. “The early morning peaceful arrest confirms our position on how effective local initiative can do well in homeland security.” He added, “We were not shocked that but for the intervention by the leadership in Oyo State, the Police would have gone after the OPC boys instead of taking the criminal from them and doing the needful. “Nigeria is going nowhere with a security network that shuns federalism.”
