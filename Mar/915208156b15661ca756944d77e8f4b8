 FOLASHADE KEHINDE WIFE of the President, Aisha Buhari, has returned to Nigeria after spending about six months in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The outspoken Nigerian First Lady had travelled to Dubai shortly after the wedding of one of her daughters, Hanan, to Turad, son of a former lawmaker, Mahmud Sani Sha’aban, in September 2021. Aisha reportedly returned to the country on Wednesday night. There had been insinuations that she left the country owing to growing insecurity. But one of her aides, Kabiru Dodo, had dismissed the reports in December. The first lady recently broke her long silence on International Women’s Day, identifying with victims of kidnapping and banditry in the country. Sources said she returned as quietly as she left the country.
