 BY REBECCA AJANI A 30-year old woman has narrated how she killed her mother and the circumstances that led to her gruesome act. The mother of four, identified as Blessing Jimoh, said her pastor’s revelation that her mother was a witch led to the murder, which occurred in Ile-Oluji, Ondo State. Blessing, who was paraded alongside other criminals by the Ondo State Police Command, in Akure, the state capital, said she cut off her mother’s head with a cutlass. The Police have not however been able to track the said pastor. Speaking to journalists, she said, “It was my pastor that told me that my mother was behind my insanity and that I should find a solution to my problem. “It was like something was pushing me to kill my mother after my pastor told me she was behind my insanity. I was not happy with what I did.” “After appealing to her (the deceased) and there were no changes, I had to kill her to see if my sanity would be restored. My mother is from Enugu State. I really don’t know what came over me,” she added. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Bolaji Salami, said the suspect committed the crime when she and her deceased mother were working at the farm in the Ile-Oluji area of the state. The suspect, he said, claimed that she was mentally unstable when she committed the crime. According to him, the son of the deceased, Odoh Tochukwu, had reported the case of his missing mother at the Ile-Oluji Police Station, after which police detectives swung into action and arrested the duo of Jimoh Blessing and Tope Blessing who were suspected to be behind the murder. “However, Jimoh Blessing, the daughter of the deceased, has confessed that she killed the mother. The case is currently with the SCIID for discreet investigation,” Salami noted. The suspect will soon be charged to court, according to him.
