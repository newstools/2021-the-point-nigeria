 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A middle aged-man, Adebowale Babatunde, has been arrested by the Police for allegedly impersonating a lawyer in Osun State. Babatunde was apprehended by the Police while appearing before a Magistrateâ€™s Court in Osogbo. Adorned in a shirt, tie and suit, Babatunde was suspected to be a fake legal practitioner by lawyers in the court when he was unable to move a motion appropriately in suit number MOS/M.95/2021, before Magistrate Adeyeba Adekanmi on Wednesday. The attitude of the suspect, who claimed to be practising at Oyewale & Co, Osogbo, while addressing the court made Magistrate Adeyeba and other lawyers in court to ask him questions in legal practice which he was unable to answer. Babatunde claimed to have attended the Law School in Lagos and was called to bar in 2015, but could not mention names of two of his lecturers when asked. Consequently, a warrant of arrest was issued against him right inside the courtroom and he was arrested by the Police. Speaking, Babatunde claimed that his brother was the owner of Oyewale & Co Chamber, adding that he was not aware of his presence in court. He claimed to have been approached by the mother of the respondents in the case to represent them in court. According to him, he was appearing for the first time. It was gathered that Babatunde collected a sum of N10,000 from the applicants to appear before the court. He was then arrested and taken to the State Criminal Investigation Department in Osogbo for further interrogation.
