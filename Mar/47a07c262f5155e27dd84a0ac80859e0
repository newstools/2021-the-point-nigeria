 BY ADEMETO ADELEKAN THE Benin Division of the Court of Appeal, on Monday, set aside the Judgment of the Edo State High Court, which disqualified the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and his running mate, Gani Audu, in the September 19, 2020 governorship election in the state, on the ground that Audu filled forged documents in the Form EC9 of the Independent National Electoral Commission. The High Court, presided over by Justice Courage Ogbebor, by its ruling, had said that the APC had no candidate in the election. But the APC candidate and his running mate filed separate appeals against the ruling. At the sitting on Monday, the judges unanimously said there was no evidence that Gani Audu forged his credentials. In the ruling, read by Justice Oyebisi Omoleye and supported by Justices B.A. Georgewill and O.E.Oho, the Appeal Court said the suit at the High Court was filed out of time by two days, adding that the case was grossly incompetent. It said this made it statue barred, adding that Oshoakpemhe could not prove the case of the forgery against Gani Audu beyond reasonable doubt by providing the original of the forged document to the court. The Court said the first respondent in the case was trying to make a “mountain out of mole hill and his case is grossly incompetent.” “The judgement of the trial court delivered on January 6 which disqualified the appellant and Audu Ganiyu from contesting respectively as governor and deputy governor is set aside,” it declared.
