 BY AGENCY REPORTER Leicester City coach Brendan Rodgers spoke to the media on Friday before his side’s Emirates FA Cup clash against Manchester United and one of the topics he addressed was Kelechi Iheanacho’s interview after his hat-trick against Sheffield United last weekend. The Northern Irishman praised the Nigeria international for his humility, saying he opted to thank his teammates after his first hat-trick in the Premier League rather than putting himself in the spotlight. Rodgers has attributed Iheanacho’s recent goalscoring success to his hard work, though he noted that the former Manchester City striker was not at his best in some games earlier in the season. Giving his thoughts on Iheanacho’s interview, Rodgers said: “I thought it was a fantastic interview. “The humility he had to score a hat-trick and thank everyone else. It was authentic. He respects his life as a footballer. “He appreciates the support he gets from everyone. He’s been very productive for us. As a person, he’s a great guy and plays with a smile on his face. He rarely misses a day of training. “When he’s asked upon, he produces in the main. There have been some performances where he hasn’t been at his most confident”. Iheanacho has netted ten goals in all competitions so far this season, equaling his best Leicester City goal tally for a single season he first recorded in 2019-2020.
