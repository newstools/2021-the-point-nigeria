 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Nigeria Labour Congress has said it will begin a nationwide protest on Wednesday. The protest, which will be reportedly joined by other trade unions, is being planned to express the unions’ displeasure over alleged attempts by the National Assembly to remove the Minimum Wage from the Exclusive Legislative List to the Concurrent Legislative List. A statement from the NLC headquarters, in Abuja, on Tuesday, noted that the mobilisation would start from the Unity Fountain Abuja, at 7.30 am, to the National Assembly complex. The NLC had threatened, a few days ago, to embark on a nationwide protest as from March 10, saying the protest would hold in the 36 states’ Houses of Assembly. The House of Representatives had debated a Bill to remove the powers to negotiate wage matters from the Exclusive to the Concurrent list, citing the inability of some governors to pay the current N30,000 minimum wage. But the umbrella labour union said it would resist any attempt to destroy Nigeria’s working class. The NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said, “The NEC decided that there will be a national protest, commencing from March 10, 2021 in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and especially to the National Assembly. “The protest is to make a strong statement that Nigerian workers would not lie low and watch hard-fought rights, which are of global standards, bastardised by opportunistic and narrow-thinking politicians.” “The NEC resolved that the national protest will be concurrently held in all the 36 states of the federation and to the different states’ Houses of Assembly across Nigeria,” he noted.
