 RIMI ALIU THE National Examination Council has withheld the results of over 30,000 students of Niger State. The affected students may therefore not be able to pursue their admissions into higher institutions. NECO withheld the results of the students, owing to the failure of the state government to pay the examination fees of its students, it was gathered. The inability of the Niger government to pay the said fees, had however been linked to the paucity of funds confronting the state. Students who graduated in 2019 and 2020 from the state have yet to access their results, owing to the debt, some stakeholders said. The Niger State Government had earlier said that the NECO fees of non-indigenes and indigent students who did not get seven credits in the state-organised mock examinations would not be taken care of. But it was alleged that the fees of those who paid to the state government had not also been forwarded to NECO. The parents of the affected students have therefore called on the Government to please pay the outstanding fees urgently. Head, Information and Public Relations Division, Azeez Sani, however, said, “The result of every candidate that paid and registered in Niger had been released. We cannot withhold results of Students who have paid, those withheld are those owing.” Sani directed the students and parents who said they had paid and registered in the state to go to the Minna office of NECO to check for their results.
