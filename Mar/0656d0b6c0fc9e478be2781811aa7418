 RIMI ALIU THE Zamfara State Government has imposed a curfew on Jangebe town. This action was taken following the crisis that erupted in the Community after the release of the abducted students of Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe. The Zamfara State Police Command has therefore been told to ensure total enforcement of the curfew. The Commissioner for Information in the state, Sulaiman Tunau Anka, said in a statement that the decision was taken in order to prevent any further breach of peace. He said, ‘’Similarly, there is strong evidence of market activities in the town that aid and abet bandits’ activities in the town and neighbouring communities. “Consequently, all market activities in the town are hereby suspended until further notice. ‘’The state government is poised to ensure the safety of lives and properties of its citizens at all costs.’’
