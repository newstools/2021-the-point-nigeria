 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THERE was tension at Okuku Community headquarters of the Odo-Otin Local Government Area, Osun State, on Thursday, as an explosive device detonated and injured a female shop owner. It was gathered that the incident happened around 7:30am when a female shop owner, opposite Olokuku palace, was cleaning her shop as part of the directive of the state government for all shop owners in the state to do a thorough cleaning of places of doing business. It was learnt that the explosive device was left behind by armed robbers who invaded a new generation bank on March 11, 2021 and carted away money. A resident, who simply identified herself as Shola, said, “The shop where the incident happened was the spot where the armed robbers alighted and distributed weapons to themselves before they commenced the robbery last week Thursday. “The woman after sweeping the surroundings of her shop was burning the refuse when the explosive detonated and injured her.” When contacted, the Spokesperson for the Police Command in Osun State, Mrs Yemisi Opalola, said the details of the incident were not available.
