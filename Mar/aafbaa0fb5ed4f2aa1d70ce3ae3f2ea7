 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THREE passengers kidnapped in Osu town along Ife/Ilesha Expressway, in Osun State, have regained freedom. One of those abducted, simply identified as Usman, is said to be a brother of Seriki Hausa of Iyere town, while the identities of the other two victims could not be immediately ascertained. The victims were said to have been taken to a forest in Osu after their vehicle was intercepted by the gunmen. The Police had collaborated with members of the Hunters Group of Nigeria in the State to launch a manhunt for the kidnappers with a view to saving the abductees. When contacted on the telephone on Monday, Yemisi Opalola, the spokesperson for the Osun State Police Command, said that only the Seriki’s brother regained freedom. Opalola argued that he was the only person that was kidnapped. The Police spokesperson denied any payment of ransom by the abductee’s family before he regained freedom. “I can only confirm to you that one person has been rescued and he was the only person kidnapped. There was no ransom paid before his release,” Opalola said. The Seriki Hausa of Iyere community, Haruna Tanko, also confirmed that his brother regained freedom.
