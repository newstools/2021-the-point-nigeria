 BY REBECCA AJANI PROFESSOR Oluwakemi Ayoola, wife of the late Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources in the state, Hon. Kehinde Ayoola, is dead. Her death came as a shock to many, as she reportedly breathed her last on Monday night, 10 months after the death of her late husband. The cause of her death could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, but she was said to have been ill after the demise of her husband. Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has described her death as sad and painful. Makinde said Mrs. Ayoola’s death came as a rude shock, stating that the exit of the academic is a great loss to the state. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Taiwo Adisa, indicated that the death of Prof. Ayoola, a teacher at the Obafemi Awolowo University’s Institute of Agriculture Research and Training, Ibadan, came months after her husband and immediate past Commissioner for Environment, passed on. The governor, who commiserated with the Ayoola family of Apaara Quarters, Oyo town, especially the two children of the late professor, prayed God to grant repose to the souls of the couple. He said, “I received the news of the death of Professor Oluwakemi Ayoola, wife of my friend and brother, Rt. Hon. Kehinde Ayoola, who died in active service to the state, and I must say that it is painful and sad. “The death of Mrs. Ayoola is particularly painful because it happened at this time when her two sons and the entire family need her the most as a bulwark and support following the death of her husband. “Her death is equally a loss to the state, because she has risen to the peak of her career as a professor and her wealth of experience would have benefited the state immensely. “While commiserating with the family, I also pray to God to grant repose to the soul of Prof. Ayoola and her husband, Rt. Hon. Ayoola.”
