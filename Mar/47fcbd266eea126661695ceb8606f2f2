 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Victor Osimhen has received medical clearance to return to action, two days before Napoli’s Serie A clash against Bologna. The Nigeria international was able to join his teammates in full training on Friday, taking part in passing drills and technical work, before playing a mini-match. This new development will be sweet music to the ears of Super Eagles manager Gernot Rohr who is planning to include the former Lille goal poacher in his squad list for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers this month. Osimhen missed Napoli’s last three matches as a result of the head injury he suffered in the closing minutes against Atalanta on February 21. Neurosurgeon Alfredo Bucciero, who was with Osimhen at the Pineta Grande hospital in Castel Volturno this morning, revealed that it is up to the coaching staff to decide if he is in the team to face Bologna. “Osimhen is well and can be enlisted. Gattuso will decide whether to play him against Bologna, from a clinical point of view there are no problems,” Bucciero stated. “The magnetic resonance confirmed that there is nothing, as at the first exam last week. “As for the encephalogram there was some small anomaly, as normal in trauma, but it returned.” This season, Osimhen, who wears the number 9 jersey for Napoli and the Super Eagles, has scored 3 goals combined in 17 appearances for club and country.
