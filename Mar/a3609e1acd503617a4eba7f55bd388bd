 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A gang of suspected armed robbers, on Tuesday night, ambushed some passengers along Osogbo/Ibokun road in Osun State, killing one. The notorious gang was said to have barricaded the road around 8:00pm on Tuesday before ambushing some vehicles plying the road. It was gathered that the suspected robbers robbed some passengers of their money and other valuables and left the scene after shooting one of their victims. During the robbery, distress calls had been made by some residents of the state who alerted security agencies to come to the rescue of the victims. To this end, the Osun State Security Network, codenamed Amotekun, arrived the scene of the attack after some minutes. The corps were said to have met the barricade mounted by the robbers and removed them. The field commander of Amotekun in the state, Comrade Amitolu Shittu, was said to have received a distress call from the residents of Ibokun who raised the alarm of the robbery operation. The prompt intervention of Amotekun Corps was said to have saved other users of the road against the barricade mounted by the armed robbers who killed one of the passengers of the vehicle that was heading to Esa-Oke from Osogbo. The name of the dead victim was unknown as of the time of filling this report. The remains of the victim have been deposited at the Morgue of the Osun State General Hospital, Asubiaro, Osogbo.
