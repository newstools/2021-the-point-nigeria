 BY REBECCA AJANI GROUPS within the All Progressives Congress in Oyo State have vowed to resist alleged moves by Governor Seyi Makinde to join the party. Though there is a crisis within the Peoples Democratic Party in the South West, which has led to the postponement of its Congress, there has not been any statement by Governor Makinde to suggest that he is planning to dump the party. However, the APC stakeholders’ groups – the Oyo Solidarity Front, Oyo Progressives Resolute and Oyo Sustainable Development Movement – on Monday, advised him to look elsewhere for a softlanding, after allegedly being “rejected by his party.” They also accused him of betraying all those who worked in the coalition that produced him as Governor. In a joint statement signed by the chairmen and secretaries of the groups, Johnson Olooto, Shina Alubankudi, Waheed Olanrewaju, Sunday Olododo, Ibrahim Arikewusola and Daud Arapaja, respectively, the stakeholders attacked the Governor, saying he had become a leper that “should not be allowed to mix with normal, healthy people.” They said, “He has been rejected by his party and its leadership in the South West and he is looking for a soft landing, he should move further than the APC. “He has always claimed to be popular. He should stake his popularity in any of the other political parties in the country, not in APC where he has elevated his attack on the party leadership to a state policy. “He betrayed all those who worked for him to emerge as Governor, leading to the collapse of the coalition. “All the people that helped him to power are no longer with him. Former Governor Ayodele Fayose was the person that handed over the PDP flag to him as party flag bearer, today, he is at loggerheads with his benefactor. “His antics have left his party more divided and many have deserted him. He would be an albatross on the neck of APC in Oyo State and we will resist his attempt at joining our party.”
