 REBECCA AJANI THE Ekiti State Police Command has confirmed the arrest of three suspects in connection with the killings and violence that marred the Ekiti East State Constituency 1 bye-election on Saturday. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Tunde Mobayo, said the suspects, who were apprehended in their hideout, were being detained at the police headquarters in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. The Ekiti East State Constituency 1 seat became vacant, owing to the death of the lawmaker representing the constituency, Juwa Adegbuyi, in February. Three persons were reportedly shot dead, while five others sustained gunshot injuries during the bye-election on Saturday. Governor Kayode Fayemi has condemned the incident in strong terms, saying that the perpetrators would be fished out and brought to book. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Sunday Abutu, who spoke on behalf of the Commissioner of Police, assured residents that those arrested would be charged to court at the end of investigation. “Three suspected party thugs have been arrested. They were picked up where they were hiding and are now being detained in our headquarters. Murder is a capital offence and the police won’t watch and allow anyone to take the law into his own hands. Nigeria is a nation being guided by laws,” he said. “Just like we assured our people on Saturday, everyone who had hands in the killings will be brought to justice. I am assuring that all those that were arrested will be taken to court as soon as we conclude investigations and gather enough evidence,” the PPRO added. He, however, said, “No police officer died during the shooting by party thugs. Though one of our officers was shot, but she didn’t die, as wrongly speculated. “The policewoman, who though was in a critical condition yesterday (Saturday), is now responding to treatment. She is getting better.”
