 SALIU SALIU THE Military, on Sunday, foiled another attempt by gunmen to kidnap workers from the staff quarters of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, at the Kaduna Airport. But the successful operation was not without a gun battle between the military men and the bandits who had reportedly gained access to the quarters through the porous part of the airport. The incident occurred barely two days after troops rescued 180 students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Kaduna, where 30 students were abducted. Though no casualty was recorded, the incident has sent panic waves across the quarters, with many workers preparing to find alternative accommodation in a more secure environment. The gunmen were said to have flashed torch lights as they headed for the apartments. The prompt military intervention was said to have been made possible as a result of a timely distress call by some residents. The Federal Government has said it will ensure the security of lives and property by dealing decisively with bandits who have continued to terrorise the nation.
