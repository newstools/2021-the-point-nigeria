BY LINUS CHIBUIKE SALIHU Tanko-Yakasai, media aide to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, who was sacked for what was described as unguarded comments on the kidnap of Zamfara schoolgirls, has been released from the custody of the Department of State Services. Abdullahi, Salihu’s brother, made this known via his Twitter handle. “Alhamdulilah. My brother @dawisu is out. Thank you all #freedawisu,” Abdullahi tweeted. The DSS had said the arrest of Tanko-Yakassai followed issues beyond the expression of opinion in the social media. The Public Relations Officer of the Service, Dr Peter Afunanya, announced this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. “This is to confirm that Salihu Tanko-Yakasai is with the DSS and he is being investigated over issues beyond the expression of opinions in the social media as wrongly alleged by sections of the public,’’ he stated. His father, elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, had first disclosed to the media that his son was in the custody of security agencies. The media aide had called for the resignation of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress administration, saying it had failed Nigerians in the area of security.
