 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA The President, National Executive Committee (NEC) and the entire members of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) has felicitated with the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick on his well-deserved election into the Executive Committee of the world football governing body, FIFA. This victory according to SWAN came at the 43rd Ordinary and Elective General Assembly of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in Morocco, will no doubt help to reposition and further develop football in Nigeria after the efforts of the late Etubom Oyo Orok Oyo and Dr. Amos Adamu who once served in that exalted position. SWAN is further thrilled that the NFF President was so popular among the world football family that he overwhelmingly defeated his rival and the incumbent, Walter Nyamilamdu of Malawi by 43 to 8 votes. SWAN then urged the new FIFA council member to ensure that he brings his wealth of experience to bear by ensuring that his region and indeed Nigeria benefit from the numerous youth developmental programmes of FIFA. SWAN equally urges Pinnick to be a worthy ambassador of Nigeria and avoid the usual banana peels that have pulled down most people that have served in that capacity in the past. “We also applaud the federal government for the unflinching support it gave to Pinnick even as we charge the government to always collaborate with him to get rid of some of the administrative bottlenecks that have hindered the growth and development of football in Nigeria. “On our part, we as a body will continue to remain a dependable partner and always ready to contribute to the development of football in particular and sports in general,” SWAN concluded in a statement made available to reporters.
