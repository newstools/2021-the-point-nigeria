 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, welcomed the release of abducted students of the Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, Zamfara State. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said in a statement early Tuesday that the President was happy that the ordeal of the girls came to a happy end without any incident. The statement, titled, ‘President Buhari celebrates release of abducted Zamfara female students, calls for greater vigilance,’ quoted Buhari as saying, “I join the families and people of Zamfara State in welcoming and celebrating the release of these traumatised female students.” “Being held in captivity is an agonising experience, not only for the victims but also their families and all of us,” he added. The President however called for greater vigilance by Nigerians so that human intelligence could be collected early enough to nip the bandits’ plans in the bud. He said the time had come to reverse, completely, the grim and heartbreaking incidents of kidnapping. While urging the Police and the Military to go after kidnappers and bring them to justice, Buhari warned against ransom payments, saying it would “continue to prosper kidnapping.”
