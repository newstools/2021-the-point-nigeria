 AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI GOVERNOR David Umahi of Ebonyi State has ordered the arrest of the Ohaukwu Council Chairman, Clement Odah, and the member representing Ohaukwu North State Constituency, Chinedu Awo, over the lingering communal crisis between the people of Effium and Ezza-Effium in Effium Community of Ohaukwu Local Government Area of the state. Odah and Awo, who hail from Effium community, were accused of being the brains behind the crisis. Umahi stressed that the two leaders should not be allowed to possess any phone or be treated with courtesy in detention. The Governor also ordered the arrest of the spokesperson for the Effium clan, James Agina, as well as the spokesperson for Ezza-Effium, Titus Nworie. Umahi, who gave the order on Monday, during a security/reconciliatory meeting on the Effium lingering communal crisis held at Ecumenical centre, Abakaliki, said the Vice Chairman of Ohaukwu LGA should take over the affairs of the council in acting capacity. He expressed concern over a WhatsApp page created by the member representing Ezza South State Constituency, Chris Uzulor. According to him, the WhatsApp page was created to ask for relief in support of the victims. He, therefore, directed the lawmaker to shutdown the WhatsApp page. Similarly, Governor Umahi ordered the arrest of some stakeholders of Abaomege and Isinkwo community, following a renewed land dispute between the two communities. Eight stakeholders, who were present during a security meeting presided over by the Governor between the two communities at the old Executive Council Chambers, were subsequently arrested by the Police. Umahi further directed the Police Commissioner not to release any of the stakeholders arrested until the people stopped shooting and demarcation of the disputed area carried out. He also called on the Police to ensure that those who were not present were fished out and detained, adding that if they were not fished out within two days, they must be declared wanted.
