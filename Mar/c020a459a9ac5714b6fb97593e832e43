It is shocking and strange to our communities. “We are here on behalf of the state government to sympathise with you and we are assuring you that those criminal elements that perpetrated this evil act would not go scot-free. We have ordered security agencies to swing into action and fish them out to face the wrath of law.” He, however, called on members of the community to assist security agents with useful information that could speed up the arrest of the killers.
