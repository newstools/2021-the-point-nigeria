 BY REBECCA AJANI CHAIRMAN, Oyo State Motor Parks Disciplinary Committee, Mukaila Lamidi, popularly known as Auxiliary, has warned a former Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Mulikat Adeola-Akande, to stop accusing him of plotting to assassinate her. His reaction followed an allegation by Adeola-Akande, last week, that those she described as the killer squad of Auxiliary were after her life. She had urged the Governor Seyi Makinde government of Oyo State to caution him. However, Lamidi refuted her claims at a press conference in Ibadan, saying he could not even identify the person who raised the alarm. Warning the former Reps majority leader to refrain from politics of destruction, Lamidi said his duty was not to fight government’s battles but to oversee the activities of union members. He also challenged the troubled Adeola-Akande to arrest anyone found to be trailing her. “I heard the former majority leader of the House of Representatives, Alhaja Mulikat Adeola-Akande, alleged that I am after her life. This is mischievous and misleading. For God sake, I cannot identify her even if I see her,” he claimed. “Governor Makinde did not ask me to get involved in politics but to work with commercial drivers in the state. I don’t know her and I cannot involve myself in the politics of Oyo State. I urge her to look elsewhere for those behind her ordeal,” the union leader added.
