 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE NATIONAL Security Adviser, Maj-Gen. Babagana Monguno (retd), has said renowned Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, is empowered by the Constitution of Nigeria to deal with bandits. He said the cleric, who had come under severe criticisms from Nigerians over his dealings with bandits terrorising Nigeria, believed his approach would solve the problems at hand. Monguno, who spoke on Thursday at a State House Briefing, in Abuja, added that Gumi had resolved to help the Federal Government in its fight against banditry and criminality and that he was welcome. The Coalition of Northern Groups had warned the Nigerian Army not to disrespect Gumi, noting that the criticism and vicious attack on him had only given criminals a greenlight to continue their odious activities. The Coalition said it expected the military and other security agencies to provide Gumi with the necessary support to achieve the needed result against banditry, if they were actually serious in discharging their primary assignment of securing the lives and properties of citizens. Gumi had been interfacing with the bandits in the wake of renewed criminalities and had also advised the Federal Government to give blanket amnesty to them if Nigeria must surmount the challenge. According to Monguno, Gumi’s approach is in order as the Federal Government believes in the combative and dialogue approach to ending the menace. “Sheikh Gumi is doing what he is doing because he believes in what he is doing. He is a Nigerian. Under the Constitution, he can talk with anybody, he can deal with anybody. “I met with him when I went with the Service Chiefs to Kaduna. We spoke generally during the meeting and he resolved to help Government. We are waiting. That is all I can say; we are waiting for him.”
