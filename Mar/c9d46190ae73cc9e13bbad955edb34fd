 BY REBECCA AJANI THE Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti State has said that it is not aware of a meeting called by what it described as a “non-existent” reconciliation committee, headed by former Governor of Osun State, Olagunsoye Oyinlola. The party enjoined members to shun such meeting, saying it was a plot by Oyinlola and “his paymasters” in Ibadan to cause a division within the party. This position was made public in a statement by the state Publicity Secretary of the party, Raphael Adeyanju. Adeyanju said it was funny that someone of Prince Oyinlola’s standing would be promoting factions and illegality in the party by associating with those he called impostors in the South-West states. He said, “Our attention has been drawn to a meeting scheduled for Saturday in Ado Ekiti by Prince Oyinlola under the guise of a non-existing reconciliation committee. “We wish to state that the State Working Committee (SWC) of the PDP in Ekiti State is not aware of such meeting. “Therefore, all members of the PDP in Ekiti State are enjoined to shun the meeting as it is obviously another of the plots by Prince Oyinlola and his paymaster in Ibadan, Oyo State to cause division in the party.” “Here in Ekiti, concerted efforts are being made to resolve issues among the stakeholders and as a follow up to the meeting held in Abuja on Monday, another meeting will be held in Lagos on Monday, next week,” the party noted.
