 REBECCA AJANI NATIONAL Leader of Pan Yoruba Socio-Political Group, Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, has stepped aside. Pa Fasoranti, 95 years old, who became the Group’s leader in 2008, gave the baton of leadership to Chief Ayo Adebanjo, citing old age. Adebanjo, who was the Deputy National Leader, is now the acting National Leader of Afenifere, while the former Financial Secretary, Oba Oladipo Olaitan, the Alaago of Kajola Ago, Atakumosa East Council Area, Ilesa, Osun State, becomes the Deputy National Leader. Fasoranti announced the development during the group’s monthly meeting, held in Akure, the Ondo State capital. He said the move became necessary as a result of the need for the group to have an improved organisation more than ever before, with a more effective approach to combating the monstrous invasion of the Yoruba culture and pride. “Only a more alike and active leadership can achieve this. At 95, I am hardly able to provide such and so it is time for me to step aside,” Pa Fasoranti said. “At this junction, I am proud to announce Chief Ayo Adebanjo, a politician of the Awolowo school of thought, as Acting leader of Afenifere and His Royal Highness, Oba Oladipo Olaitan, the Alaago of Kajola Ago in Atakumosa East Local Government Area, as the Deputy Leader,” he added.
