 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI THE Ebonyi State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Comrade Ikechukwu Nwafor, has described the minimum wage being paid in Ebonyi State as fake. Nwafor made this assertion while addressing newsmen on the proposed NLC nationwide rally on Wednesday, 10th March 2021. The state NLC boss disclosed that the planned rally was an avenue to register the workers’ displeasure over the proposed removal of minimum wage from the executive list by the National Assembly through a bill before it, sponsored by Senator Datti Mohammed from Kaduna State. Nwafor threatened that should the National Assembly succeed in removing the minimum wage from the Exclusive List as reported, the lawmakers had declared war with the workers in the country. He said, “Yes, certainly, Ebonyi State will take part in the proposed nationwide NLC rally on 10th March 2021. The essence of the rally is about minimum wage. Like we all know, the issue of minimum wage has been a very big issue in Nigeria. “Unfortunately up till now, so many states have not been able to pay the N30,000 new minimum wage. Some states paid fake minimum wage like the Ebonyi State Government. What they paid in Ebonyi was not minimum wage, but they claimed they did. I stand to challenge it.” “I will always tell them what is the correct minimum wage. So whoever agrees with them on what they pay is fraudulent,” he declared.
