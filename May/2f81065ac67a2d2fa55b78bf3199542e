 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE ALAAFIN of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, has described the situation around insecurity in Nigeria, and the Federal Government’s efforts at tackling it, as an anomaly. The first class monarch said instead of the Federal Government to have an upper hand, bandits and kidnappers now had what he called a monopoly of violence over the Government. The Alaafin spoke at the 51st birthday celebration of the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, in Lagos, at the weekend. “The monopoly of violence must be concentrated in government but, regrettably, we are not having that now. Bandits and kidnappers now have monopoly of violence over the government, which is the reason we are in this current situation,” he stated. While commending Gani Adams for his steadfastness and doggedness in the struggle for the liberation of the Yoruba race, Adeyemi noted that he (Adams) had proved that his appointment was divine. “Gani Adams’ appointment is divine and based on merit. He did not contest for it, neither did he struggle for it. He was divinely appointed and my prayer is that you will lead the Yoruba race for a long time,” he said. Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, who also spoke at the event, advised that everyone needed to play active roles in addressing the security challenges confronting the country.
He was represented by his Senior Special Assistant on Tourism, Wale Ojo-Lanre. According to Fayemi, with love and unity, all the issues fueling agitation in Nigeria will be a thing of the past.
