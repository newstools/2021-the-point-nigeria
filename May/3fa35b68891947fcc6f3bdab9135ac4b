 BY NGOZI OKORIE OHANAEZE Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has raised the alarm over the whereabouts of the Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Fr. Ejike Mbaka. The youths said the fiery cleric, who had been for some days at loggerheads with the Presidency over a statement he made calling for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari or his impeachment by the National Assembly, was said to have been last seen on Tuesday. OYC, in a statement issued by its President-General, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, said every effort to trace Mbaka had failed, and gave the Federal Government 48 hours to produce him or face the wrath of the youths. He said, “We have it on good authority that his aides have neither seen nor heard from him since Tuesday. “Calls put to his mobile line have also remained unanswered; this has now prompted us to issue this alarm as we would not take it lightly should anything untoward happen to him. “We are giving the Federal Government 48 hours to produce the priest, else they should be ready to face Igbo youths. They were dining and wining with him all along and now that he told the truth, they are no longer comfortable with him.” “Let nothing happen to Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka. It will not be in anybody’s interest,” OYC warned. A message inviting some youths to the Adoration ground had also read, “Good morning friends and well-wishers. Please if you know you stand for justice and you do not want the lone voice that speaks for the poor in this country to be silenced, gather at Adoration ground let’s go for a protest at the Bishops court. “Fr. Mbaka is nowhere to be found. He went yesterday to answer the Bishop’s call and up till now, he’s not taking his calls. Let’s gather! SSG.”
