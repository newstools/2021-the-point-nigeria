 ANDREW EKEJIUBA Crotone’s all-time top scorer Simeon Tochukwu Nwankwo has revealed that he was disappointed after Juventus superstar Cristiano Ronaldo rejected his offer to swap shirts. The Nigeria international was keen to secure Ronaldo’s jersey following a Serie A clash this season but the Portugal icon handed the shirt to his compatriot Pedro Pereira. Ronaldo and Simy are having a spectacular season, with the Nigerian netting nineteen goals, eight less than the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star who has played fewer games. The Super Eagles star says he would like to have the shirts of Barcelona captain Lionel Messi and Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski in the future. “I tried to exchange the shirt with Cristiano Ronaldo , but he gave it to Pedro Pereira who is Portuguese like him.”The Crotone marksman continued: “I would like those of Messi and Lewandowski “. Simy’s impressive tally of nineteen goals failed to save Crotone from relegation to the second-tier of Italian football.
