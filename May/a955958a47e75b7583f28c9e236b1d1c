 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO OSUN State Police Command on Friday arrested a teenager and one other for allegedly dispossessing travellers of their belongings. The suspects, Abiodun Abdulahi, aged 35, living in Ado-Ekiti and a 19 year-old- boy, Godwin John, who hails from Imo State, were said to have robbed passengers of a bus coming from Lagos around 9:45am on Friday. The robbery took place at Ife/Osun express road in Osun State, according to the Commandâ€™s Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola. She said the suspects were arrested at 12noon by Policemen after they had escaped the scene. Luck was said to have run out of the suspects when the victim later visited a bank to block his ATM that was robbed. The victim saw the suspects at the banking hall in Ile-Ife and alerted the police before the duo were apprehended. The suspects were said to have wanted to withdraw some cash with the ATM they robbed before they were nabbed. Opalola said the suspects confessed to the crime and that efforts were on to arrest other fleeing gang members.
