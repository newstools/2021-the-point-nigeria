 BY NGOZI OKORIE HOODLUMS, on Sunday night, attacked the Anambra State headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission and reportedly set ablaze seven vehicles, 50 generating sets and other equipment belonging to the Commission. The attack began at about 9pm, causing pandemonium in the state capital as gunshot sounds filled the air for a long time. The gunmen were said to have fired gunshots around the B Division Police Station before storming the INEC office, close to the Division. They were said to have, however, abandoned three Hilux vans when they were overpowered by police operatives. Eight AK 47 and pump-action rifles, including live ammunition were recovered from the hoodlums, among others. Commissioner of Police, Anambra State, Christopher Owolabi, said some attackers allegedly fled with serious wounds, adding that the Command was already combing hospitals to track them. He said, “The hoodlums first went to “B” division police station and were repelled. Then they came to INEC and our men repelled them too. “I can tell you that we recorded about 95 per cent success. There were no casualties on the part of the police contrary to some media reports that scores of policemen were killed.” “Since last night, we have been moving from hospital to hospital, because we are sure some of the attackers escaped with serious wounds and we are appealing to the management of various hospitals to help us track them,” the Commissioner added.
