 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Indigenous People of Biafra has reportedly entered into an agreement with a pro-independence movement in western Cameroon, ‘Ambazonia Governing Council’ (AGovC), in the area of weapon and personnel exchange. The agreement is said to be geared towards helping the two groups achieve their common goals of freedom. Created in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB had over the years condemned the Nigerian government for its poor investment, inequitable resource distribution, marginalization, and heavy military presence in the region. IPOB is demanding the restoration of an independent state of Biafra in the South East through an independence referendum. AGovC, on its part, is fighting to carve out Cameroon’s English-speaking North-West and South-West regions into a breakaway state called Ambazonia. Grievances of Anglophone Cameroonians date back to 1961, when the region was granted independence from Britain. Foreign Policy, an American news publication, which reported the new alliance, said, “The scope of the alliance will include joint operations and training bases,” quoting the Capo Daniel, the deputy defence chief of the Ambazonia Defence Forces, the military wing of the Ambazonia Governing Council. “The groups will work to secure their shared border and ensure an open exchange of weapons and personnel, representatives of both the Ambazonia and IPOB movements said,” the report added.
