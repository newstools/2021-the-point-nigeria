 BY NGOZI OKORIE GOVERNOR Willie Obiano of Anambra State has said he is the only Nigerian governor who does not receive salary. According to him, he renders self-service to the state and sends his salary, less taxes, to destitutes. The Governor said this at his country home in Aguleri, Anambra East Local Government Area of the state after an inspection tour of the Anambra International Passenger and Cargo Airport, in Umueri. He noted that the airport was built to international standards, describing himself as a man of “classical quality”. Commissioner for Works in the state, Marcel Ifejiofor, who took the governor and his entourage round the airport facilities, said the international airport was Class 4F and could take any aircraft. He stated, “The orientation is that the aeroplane can land at either side of the runway. That was what happened on April 30, 2021, when we did the test flight. One landed on 024 and the other one landed on 06. This airport has two Runway Air Safety Areas, RASA. “This is the only airport in Nigeria with this type of RASA. It has category two light which means that the airplane can land at the worst of any weather in this airport. “It also has satellite facilities which mean that if the light is not working, aircraft can land with the satellite facilities. So with what we have on this airport, it would be difficult to have a cancelled flight.” “It is the only airport in Nigeria with this type of satellite facilities. This is the only airport in Nigeria that is current with the Friction Test. Before the airplane landed on the 30th, we carried out the test and got 0.79 which is the highest so far in this country. The height of the Control Tower is 34.5,” the Commissioner added. He pointed out that work on the airport would be completed soon, adding that passengers who would use the airport would have the best of air travel experience.
