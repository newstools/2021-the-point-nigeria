 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO STUDENTS of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Osun State, on Friday, attempted to mob a man suspected to be a ritualist for allegedly picking human faeces. The students were said to have sighted the man, identified as Wasiu Olasukomi, aged 30, around Muslim Grammar School, Ede, where he was picking dry human faeces for alleged money ritual purposes. The undergraduates had started mobbing Olasukomi and attempted to lynch him before a team of Policemen arrived the scene and rescued him from the mob. Displeased by the police intervention, the students engaged in violent protest as some students and indigenes of the town started hurling stones and other pebbles at the policemen and other teachers of the affected Grammar School. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Osun State Police Command, Yemisi Opalola, said the police reinforced more cops before the mob was dispersed. “Five suspects had been arrested as investigation is ongoing,” Opalola said.
