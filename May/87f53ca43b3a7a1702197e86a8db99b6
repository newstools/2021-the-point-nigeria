 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI THE Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 9, Etim Okon, has paid a working visit to Ebonyi State on account of the festering security challenges in the state. During the stakeholders’ meeting, organised by the Nigeria Police on the occasion, the AIG expressed concern on the spate of insecurity in the state, saying that Ebonyi was known for peace and harmony. Okon said, “The most annoying part of the insecurity in the state is the incessant killing of Police officers, burning of stations and making away with arms and ammunition. “Stakeholders should call those responsible for the hideous crime to order because they are from different communities of the state. “Today, the hoodlums are killing police and other security agents. By the time they finish killing security men, they will come after you.” The Commissioner of Police in the state, Alyiu Garba, said, “No Police anywhere in the world had ever claimed to achieve success without the collaboration of the society. You must contribute your quota in a bid to end insecurity in the state.” The state Chairman of the Nigeria Youth Council, Elder Sam Igwe, said giving the youths a sense of belonging would go a long way in securing the nation. “The Police should see the youths as partners in progress, they should always be given fair hearing at any particular point in time,” he added. The Chairman, Local Government Advisory Committee, Hycinth Nwode, said the best way to end insecurity in the country was by providing employment to the youths. Miss Esther Nwite, who represented Faith Community Counseling Organization, a non-governmental organization on the occasion, urged governments at all levels to prioritise the welfare of youths in order to discourage them from engaging in crime.
