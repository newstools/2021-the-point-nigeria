 AFTER the recent disturbance of some communities in Niger State by bandits and Boko Haram elements, the Niger State Government on Friday, April 30th, 2021, successfully relocated 3500 internally displaced persons to Gwada Model Primary School. Governor Abubakar Bello detailed relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies, through the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), to ensure that the IDPs were accommodated and all their needs met until “security improves and they are relocated back to their communities.” Governor Abu Sani Bello who saw to it that food items and other essentials worth millions of naira were purchased was said to have expressed optimism that the communities would soon be secured as the State and Federal Government were working assiduously to see that the criminals encroaching into the state were wiped out. Between the hours of 1pm and 8pm, on Friday, the IDPs were relocated to Gwada from IBB Primary School, Minna, the 3-Arm Zone, Gurusu and Maitumbi Sarkin Fulani’s house, while most of the others staying with relatives and kind neighbours were also mobilised and relocated. To ensure harmony, the leaders of the Gbagy and Fulani communities were invited to camp by NSEMA and constituted as part of the camp management officials to assist in running camp activities. The food, non-food items and sanitary materials that were procured have been made available to camp officials. The Niger State Government has provided security alongside a clinic manned by officials of the state’s Ministry of Health.
