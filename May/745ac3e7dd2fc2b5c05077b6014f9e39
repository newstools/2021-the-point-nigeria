 BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA Ndi Eze Igbo in the 19 Northern States and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have applauded the Governors of the South-East Geo-Political Zone for setting up a joint security outfit to tackle the high rate of insecurity in the region. The mornachs called on the states’ Houses of Assembly of the zone to give a legal backing to the joint security outfit for optimum performance. A communique issued at the end of a two-day meeting in Abuja, signed by the group’s National President, HRH Eze Pampas Iwehiwe, and HRH Eze Boniface Ibekwe, Eze Igbo Kano, urged the new security outfit, EbubeAgu, to closely work with other security agencies in the zone to curtail the excesses of insecurity and other forms of banditry in the zone. While condemning the attacks and destruction of police stations and other government properties in the zone, the association urged the youths to shun restiveness and other vices capable of disrupting public peace. Ndi Eze also called on the Federal and state governments to beef up security in all educational institutions across the states, in order to tackle abduction of school children in some parts of the country. On the 2023 election, it urged other ethnic nationalities to mobilise support for the emergence of a president of Igbo extraction in the interest of peace, equity and justice. The association commended the Governors of the 19 Northern states and the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), as well as their traditional institutions, for the harmonious relationship that had existed between Ndi Igbo and their host communities. It passed a vote of confidence in the Chairman of the Igbo traditional Rulers Council Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Eze  Uche Egenti, on his leadership qualities and efforts in uniting Ndi Igbo in the FCT.
