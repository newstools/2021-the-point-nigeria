 BY AGENCY REPORTER Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson has admitted that he was delighted with the performance of Eberechi Eze during the outgoing season and insisted Palace need Eze more than Manchester United and Manchester City who are in hot chase for the player’s signature. Crystal Palace came from behind to register a 3-2 win against Aston Villa in their antepenultimate match of the season on Sunday, with Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) target Eze impressing for the Eagles. The England U21 international caused problems for the Aston Villa defence throughout the game and set up Wilfried Zaha for the goal to make it 2-2. Eze was also involved in the build-up to Palace’s winning goal when his bouncing shot was turned in by Tyrick Mitchell in the 84th minute. Crystal Palace boss Hodgson has admitted that he is aware that top Premier League teams have their eyes on the attack-minded star performer including Wilfried Zaha in the summer transfer window.“They Wilfried Zaha and Eberechi Eze are quality players,” Hodgson told reporters. “They are players that could improve quite a few Premier League teams. We need them more than a Manchester City or Manchester United would need them…” Eze, who has a contract with Palace until 2025, has directly participated in ten goals in his first season in the Premier League.
