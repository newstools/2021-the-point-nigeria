 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI THE Independent National Electoral Commission has created 1,162 additional polling units in Ebonyi State to pave the way for easier electoral processes. The new polling units cut across the 13 local government areas of the state. This is aimed at increasing voters’ access to polling units and ensuring effective participation of citizens in elections. The development brings the total number of polling units in the state to 2,947. The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Joseph Chukwu, made this known while briefing stakeholders on the outcome of the field exercise for expansion of voters’ access to polling units in Abakaliki. Chukwu said the Commission carried out the exercise in line with the directive of the national headquarters of INEC in Abuja, noting that this was geared towards ensuring that the electorate were not denied the opportunity to vote during elections. According to him, the measure will reduce unnecessary congestion usually observed in polling units in the past elections.
