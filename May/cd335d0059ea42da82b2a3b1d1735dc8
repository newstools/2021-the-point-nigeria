 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Newcastle United face competition from Portuguese giants Benfica in the race to signing Italian-born Nigerian center back Udoka Chima, but face competition from Portuguese Primeira Liga clubs. The Magpies have firmed up their interest in the former Burnley defender by inviting him to train with their youth team during the pre-season with a view to offering him a contract. Chima has been on the lookout for a new club following his release by the Clarets at the end of the 2019-2020 campaign. Primeira Liga giants Benfica are mulling over offering the 2002- born player a contract after he impressed the youth team coaches whilst undergoing trial at the Training Center of Sport Lisboa e Benfica. At the invitation of Benfica Youth Football Director, Bruno Maruta, he trained with The Eagles from the 29th of April to the 9th of May, 2021. Sporting de Braga are also in the mix to sign the 19-year-old Chima.
